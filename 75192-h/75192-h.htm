<div class="blockquot">
<p>The stories of the Three Little Trippertrots, though
never before published, have been told to thousands of children,
in a way, probably, that no tales have ever before
been related. They were read <i>over the telephone</i>, nightly, to
thousands of little folks, by means of the system operated
by the N. J. Telephone Herald Company. The stories so
delighted the children that the author has yielded to the
request to issue them in book form.</p>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE LITTLE FAIRY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were sitting around the fire after supper—Mary
and Tommy and Johnny Trippertrot, their papa and
mamma, and the old fisherman. The three children had
just come home, after having had some wonderful adventures,
and they were rather tired.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’m ever going away again,” said Mary,
who was older than her two brothers. “Never again am I
going away. Home is too nice.” And she cuddled close up
to her papa and mamma.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is nice,” replied Johnny. “I guess we won’t go
away any more.”</p>

<p>“But we had good times, didn’t we?” asked Tommy, as
he looked over at the old fisherman, who was gazing at the
fire as if wondering whether or not he could catch anything
in the flames. “We had lots of good times.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you certainly did have lots of good times,” agreed
the old fisherman.</p>

<p>“There was the time we met Simple Simon, and the
pieman, and Jiggily Jig, the funny boy, who was always
turning somersaults,” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there was the time we rode on the funny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
horses—the sawhorse, the clothes-horse and the rocking-horse,”
went on Tommy. “And when we met the man
with the dancing bears, and the man with the pink cow,
and the little lost girl, who wanted to be a boy, and whose
name was Jack. Remember that?”</p>

<p>“I guess I do,” replied Johnny. “And then there was
the time we rode in the train, and met the little old lady,
and when the fireman put out the blaze in our chimney,
and then the false-face man! Oh, he was jolly!”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t he!” exclaimed Mary. “But I’m glad we have
you with us,” she said to the old fisherman. “You are the
only friend who came home with us to stay.”</p>

<p>“I am glad I did,” returned the old fisherman.</p>

<p>And now I suppose I had better tell you, children, that
the Trippertrots were always running away, and getting
lost, though they didn’t mean to, and they came home
again as soon as they could. On their trips they met many
strange people and animals, and I have told the stories of
them in the book before this, called, “Three Little Trippertrots;
How They Ran Away, and How They Got Back
Again.” The people whom the children spoke about, as
they sat around the fire, are all mentioned in that book.
The Trippertrots, you know, lived with their papa and
mamma in a house in a big city, and there was a nursemaid,
named Suzette, who was supposed to look after them,
although she didn’t always do it, being so busy.</p>

<p>“It was very good of you to bring the children home,”
said Mrs. Trippertrot to the old fisherman. “Very kind
of you, indeed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was a pleasure for me,” answered the fisherman,
who had met the children on their last adventure, and who
had taken care of them. “We had a nice ride home in the
carriage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“And he caught a man’s tall hat by dangling a hammock-hook
out of the carriage window,” explained Mary
Trippertrot.</p>

<p>“And a lady’s bonnet,” added Tommy.</p>

<p>“And a little girl’s loaf of bread,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“But he gave them all back,” exclaimed Mary. “And,
oh, Mr. Fisherman, you promised to do some tricks for
us,” she went on. “You really did, and I think you might
do some now, to amuse us. It isn’t quite bedtime.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’d love to see some funny tricks,” said Tommy.
“Can you make a rabbit come out of a hat, or take
papa’s watch, and make a rice pudding out of it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, please do that trick!” cried Johnny. “Wouldn’t it
be funny to see a rice pudding made from father’s watch?
And could you leave the tick-tick part in the pudding, Mr.
Fisherman?”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” exclaimed Mr. Trippertrot, “I am not sure
that I want my watch made into a pudding. I need my
watch to tell the time by, so I can go to work in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry about that,” spoke the old fisherman,
with a jolly laugh. “Even if I should make a pudding of
your watch, it would not hurt it in the least, or stop it
from tick-ticking. But I think I will do some other trick.
Mary,” he said, to the little Trippertrot girl, “please let
me take your hair ribbon.”</p>

<p>So Mary handed him her hair ribbon, and her curls
fell down all about her face, making it look very pretty in
the light of the fire.</p>

<p>“Now, Johnny, you hold one end of this ribbon,” said
the old fisherman, and Johnny did so.</p>

<p>“And, Tommy, you take hold of the other end,” went
on the nice old fisherman, and there the two Trippertrot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
brothers stood, each one having hold of Mary’s hair ribbon
by the end.</p>

<p>“What kind of a trick is this going to be?” asked Mrs.
Trippertrot.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t rightly know myself,” said the old fisherman,
“for it never happens twice alike. Sometimes it comes
out one way, and sometimes another.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you think you will make a rabbit come out of
my hair ribbon?” asked Mary, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’d rather have an elephant,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Oh, an elephant would be too big to get in this house,”
said Johnny. “Besides, he might break through the floor,
and fall into the cellar, and we couldn’t get him out of the
coal-bin.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said the fisherman. “Then I guess I’d better
not make an elephant. But now we must go on with the
trick. Close your eyes, all of you children, and I’ll say the
magical words that will change the hair ribbon into something
wonderful.”</p>

<p>So Mary and Tommy and Johnny closed their eyes, and
the old fisherman waved his hands in the air. Then he recited
this little verse. But please don’t any of you children
say it, or I can’t tell what might happen. This is what the
old fisherman said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“A magic trick will now be done,</div>
<div class="verse">For children three, and two and one.</div>
<div class="verse">This ribbon must be folded tight,</div>
<div class="verse">And put away, far out of sight.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And then you all must patient wait,</div>
<div class="verse">Until the clock is striking eight,</div>
<div class="verse">Then look behind the parlor chair,</div>
<div class="verse">Perchance you’ll find a fairy there.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Oh, will we really find a fairy?” asked Mary, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the old fisherman told Johnny and Tommy that they could
open their eyes.</p>

<p>“You might,” said the old fisherman. “I never can tell
what is going to happen when I say that verse. Now the
trick is working, so I advise you all to go to bed.”</p>

<p>“But what about looking behind the parlor chair, when
the clock is striking eight?” asked Mary. “It’s nearly eight
now, and mayn’t we stay up until then, to see the finish of
the trick?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I meant eight o’clock to-morrow morning,” said
the old fisherman. “Get up then, and look.”</p>

<p>So the children said good-night to the old fisherman,
and they were just trotting off to bed, when Mary exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious! We forgot to fold the hair ribbon
tight. We must do that, or there won’t be any trick.”</p>

<p>So she and her brothers folded the hair ribbon as tightly
as they could, and placed it far away under the big chair
in the parlor, where it was out of sight, just as the fisherman
said must be done. Then the Trippertrot children
were soon fast asleep, and they could hardly wait until
eight o’clock the next morning to come, so they could see
how the trick worked.</p>

<p>“Where is the old fisherman?” cried Mary, as soon as
she could run downstairs when it was daylight again.</p>

<p>“Oh, he had to go away,” said her mamma.</p>

<p>“Then let’s go look, and see if the hair ribbon has
changed into a fairy,” suggested Tommy.</p>

<p>“No; Suzette says it isn’t eight o’clock yet,” objected
Johnny. So they ate their breakfast, and got ready for
school, and then they sat down and watched the clock until
the hands should get to the place where it would be time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
to look behind the parlor chair, to see what would be
hiding there.</p>

<p>“Now it’s time!” suddenly cried Mary, and she jumped
up, and ran into the parlor, followed by her brothers, just
as soon as the clock began to strike. The three children got
there about the same time, but Mary was the first to look
under the chair. No sooner had she done so than she
screamed:</p>

<p>“Oh, my! Oh, dear! Look there!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried Johnny. “Has the hair ribbon
turned into a doggie?”</p>

<p>“I wish it would turn into a camel with two humps on
his back,” said Tommy. “A camel isn’t too big for the
house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” cried Mary again. “The ribbon hasn’t gone
away at all! But look at that little animal sleeping on it!”</p>

<p>She pointed to something soft, and fuzzy, and furry,
lying asleep on the middle of her folded hair ribbon,
which was on the floor under the chair. And then Mary
quickly hopped up on another chair.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s nothing but a little mousie!” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“A real, live mousie?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what it is,” said his brother, and at that
Mary screamed, and tried to jump on another chair, further
away.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Johnny. “A mouse can’t
hurt girls.”</p>

<p>“But this is no trick!” cried Tommy. “That fisherman
didn’t change that hair ribbon into anything, and the mouse
just came and slept on it because he wanted to. I don’t
like this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, boys, wait!” suddenly cried Mary. “I see it all
now. This mouse is a fairy. Yes, she really is. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
fisherman made her come to sleep on my hair ribbon. Oh,
it’s just like in a story! I’m so glad. Probably that mouse
is a fairy princess in this shape until the magical spell is
broken, and she can turn into her real self again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think so,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Me either,” spoke Johnny. “It’s just an ordinary
mouse, like Suzette catches in the trap.”</p>

<p>“It is not! It’s a fairy!” insisted Mary. “Aren’t you a
fairy, little mouse?” she asked, and she liked the mousie so
that she got down off the chair, and went close to the small
creature.</p>

<p>“Squeak-squeak,” said the little mouse.</p>

<p>“There, it said ‘yes-yes,’” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you understand mouse language,” said
Tommy. “I don’t believe that’s a fairy.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is,” said Mary, “and pretty soon some wonderful
things will begin to happen. You had better look out.”</p>

<p>And just then, if you will believe me, the little mouse
ran out from under the chair, just like the one that was
under the queen’s throne. And the mousie ran out of the
parlor, into the hall, and out of the front door, that happened
to be open.</p>

<p>“Oh, the fairy is running away! We must run after
her!” cried Mary. “It would never do to have a fairy run
away, and especially the first fairy we have ever seen! Run,
boys, run!”</p>

<p>So Tommy ran and Johnny ran, and Mary ran, and in
another minute the three little Trippertrots were running
after the mouse—the fairy mouse it was, I guess—for some
wonderful things really happened because of that same
mousie. You see, the Trippertrots had now started on
their travels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“There she goes—down the street!” cried Mary. “Keep
after the fairy mouse, Tommy and Johnny!”</p>

<p>So Tommy and Johnny and Mary kept on running,
and they forgot that they were never to go away again—in
fact, they forgot about everything, except that they
were chasing the fairy mouse.</p>

<p>Faster and faster ran the mousie down the street, around
the corner, in and out among the legs and feet of the
people, faster and faster. But still the Trippertrots kept
on after the little creature, running as hard as they could
run, until, all of a sudden, the mouse saw a hole in a fence
and ran through the hole, and when Mary and Tommy
and Johnny got there, why—there wasn’t any mouse to be
seen.</p>

<p>“She—she’s gone!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“Disappeared!” gasped Tommy, who could use big
words, sometimes.</p>

<p>“Maybe she’s run home, and is sleeping under the chair
again,” suggested Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, then, we must go right back!” said Mary. “I
want to get my hair ribbon, and we must soon go to
school, and I guess maybe the fairy mouse is doing tricks
now. Yes, let’s hurry back home, boys.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Tommy and Johnny together, like
twins, you know, only they weren’t. Well, then a funny
thing happened. The Trippertrot children started to go
home, but what do you think? They were lost! They
looked all around, but they didn’t know any of the streets,
and they didn’t see anybody whom they could ask where
their house was, for all the people had suddenly gone
away.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Mary. “It’s happened again.”</p>

<p>“What has?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“Why, we’re lost,” said Mary. “Can’t you see? We
can’t find our way home!”</p>

<p>“The fairy mouse did this,” said Johnny. “It’s all part
of the game. Wait, maybe she’ll come back, and change
into a trolley car, and take us home.”</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, it began to rain. Oh, my!
How hard the drops splashed down. The children looked
to see if they could find the kind fisherman, who might fish
up an umbrella, or a pair of rubber boots, or a raincoat
for them, but he was not in sight. And Tommy looked to
see if the fairy mouse would come back, changed into an
automobile, or a trolley car, but nothing like that happened.</p>

<p>All at once, along the street came a newsboy, with a
bundle of papers under his arm. He didn’t seem to mind
the rain, and he ran up to the children, crying:</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, now. I’ll take care of you. Here, take
some of my papers, and hold them over your heads for
umbrellas. Then you won’t get wet. Come with me and
I’ll take you home.”</p>

<p>Then he handed some papers to Mary, to Tommy, and
to Johnny, who held them over their heads like Japanese
umbrellas, and they took hold of each others’ hands and
ran on. And the rain came down harder than ever, and
soon the streets were like little rivers of water.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry!” cried the newsboy. “I’ll look after you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think he must be the fairy mouse changed into a
boy,” said Mary to her brothers, and Tommy and Johnny
nodded their heads, for they thought the same thing.</p>

<p>And, then, all of a sudden, they saw a big wooden box
floating down the street, which was now filled with water.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is just the thing!” cried the newsboy. “Come
on, little ones,” and he ran toward the box. “We’ll go
sailing!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER TWO<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS GO SAILING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> newsboy kindly helped the children to get in the
box, first lifting in Mary, and then Johnny, and then
Tommy. Then he got in himself. And all the while it
kept on raining harder and harder.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” cried Mary, as she sat down in a corner of
the big box. “This is terrible! Here we are lost again,
and we don’t know where we are going.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is just the best part of it,” said the newsboy.</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“Because,” said the newsboy, “if you knew where you
were going there wouldn’t be any surprise when you got
there. And you would know just when you were going to
get there, and what you were to do after you arrived. Now
it’s all different. We don’t know where we are going, and
we don’t know when we’ll get there, and we don’t know
what we will do when we get there—if we ever do. At
least, I don’t,” he said, with a smile. “Perhaps you children
do.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Mary, with a shake of her head. “I
don’t.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t, either,” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” added Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is jolly fun!” cried the newsboy, and then the
rain came down harder than ever, and some of it splashed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
into the big box, which was like a boat sailing along the
watery street.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Mary, “my dress will get all wet!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should have thought of that before!” said the
newsboy, for the children had taken away the newspapers
from over their heads. “Wait, and I’ll make a top over
the box. Then we will be as dry as if we were in a house.”</p>

<p>So what do you think he did? He took a lot of his
papers from inside the pile under his arm, where they
were pretty dry, and he laid them over the open top of the
drygoods box, and he fastened them down with some
pins, and then the rain didn’t come in any more, for there
was a paper roof over the box-ship.</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” exclaimed Mary. “Tell me, are you the
fairy mousie, changed into a boy?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the boy, “I am not. What made you
think so?”</p>

<p>“Well, because you think of doing things so quickly,
you know. We were chasing after the fairy mousie, that
we found asleep on my hair ribbon,” said Mary, “and
that’s how we got lost.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry I’m not the fairy mousie,” said the
newsboy, “but perhaps I can help you find her. Now, do
you happen to be hungry?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tommy, turning his head on one side, so
as to let some water run out of his ear, “we had breakfast
a little while ago, but I guess I <i>am</i> hungry.”</p>

<p>“And so am I,” said Mary and Johnny.</p>

<p>“Then here is the very thing,” said the newsboy, and
with that he pulled some ginger cookies out of his pockets,
and gave them to the children—gave them the cookies, not
his pockets, you understand.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want some yourself?” asked Mary, politely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“Oh, bless you, no,” said the newsboy. “I never eat
cookies. I’m too big to eat cookies. I’ll chew on a bit of
paper instead. Here is a piece with a nice picture on it of
a dish of ice-cream and some cake. I’ll eat that bit of
paper, and I won’t be hungry for ever so long.”</p>

<p>And, then, what do you think? Why, that funny newsboy
ate the piece of paper with the picture of the ice-cream
and cake on it, and he wasn’t hungry any more.
But, of course, none of you must do that, as it’s only allowed
in fairy stories.</p>

<p>“Do you think we’ll ever get home?” asked Johnny,
after a bit, when the box had floated down the street for
some distance.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, and I’ll take a look,” said the newsboy,
and he peeked through a knot-hole in the side of the box.
“Is your house a red one?” he asked the children.</p>

<p>“No, it’s painted green,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Then the one I saw isn’t it,” spoke the newsboy. “But
we may come to it pretty soon.” And then he looked out
again, and asked: “Is your house a pink one?”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” said Mary, in surprise, “I think I told you a
little while ago that it was painted green.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, so you did. Please excuse me,” said the newsboy.
“Well, pink is a very pretty color. Wouldn’t you like
to live in a pink house?”</p>

<p>“Oh, how funny!” exclaimed Johnny. “We can’t live
in any house but our own, you know.”</p>

<p>“No more you can,” said the newsboy. “Well, perhaps
we shall come up to it very soon. Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“No, I thought you did,” said the boy. “All the children
I ever saw knew where they lived.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but we’re lost,” spoke Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“And besides,” said Johnny, “we’re the Trippertrots.
We never know where we live; do we, Tommy?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tommy, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s very strange,” went on the newsboy. “I’ll
give one more look, and then, maybe, I can see your house.
I thought I could take you home, but if you don’t know
where you live I’m sure it’s going to be quite a puzzle—quite
a puzzle,” and he shook his head up and down, and
sideways.</p>

<p>Then the drygoods box-ship went sailing on and on
down the street, and the rain kept on raining down harder
and harder, and the Trippertrots went on faster and faster.
Presently the newsboy said:</p>

<p>“Well, now I’ll take another look and see if I can find
your house.” So once more he looked out of the knot-hole
in the drygoods box, and then he asked Mary: “Could
your house possibly be a purple one? I see a nice purple
one just ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“No, our house is green!” exclaimed Mary, as politely
as she could. “I told you that before.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so you did!” cried the newsboy. “How very careless
of me to forget so often. I don’t suppose you’d like
to live in a purple house, would you?” and he looked at
Johnny and Tommy.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I would,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“No, green is our color,” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>“I was afraid so,” went on the newsboy, with a sigh.
“Well, all I can do is to float along with you until we get
to a green house. Then you’ll be home.”</p>

<p>“But it might be some other green house than ours,”
said Mary. “Many houses are painted green.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” cried the newsboy. “I never thought
of that. I haven’t seen any green houses to-day, though,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
and maybe the first one we come to will be yours. It’s
very strange. I never thought there would be so much
trouble in finding the house of the Trippertrots. But never
mind. Have some more molasses cookies,” and he took a
number of them out of his pockets, and the children were
very glad to get them, for they were hungry again.</p>

<p>Then they sailed on some more, and some more, and
they were wondering if they would ever get home, and
they began to wish that they hadn’t chased out after the
fairy mouse, for they had not been so far away from home
since the time they went on a train after seeing the pink
cow.</p>

<p>And then, all at once, just as the drygoods box-ship was
sailing around the corner of the street, and the Trippertrot
children and the newsboy were down under the papers on
top, so the rain wouldn’t get them—all at once, I say—there
was a bumpity-bump noise.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Tommy.</p>

<p>“We’ve hit something,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes, you’ve hit me!” exclaimed a voice, and then the
big box suddenly stopped, and a funny boy poked his head
in the top through the newspapers.</p>

<p>“We didn’t mean to hit you,” said Tommy, politely,
“but our box went very fast.”</p>

<p>“And we couldn’t see where we were going,” added
Johnny.</p>

<p>“All except the newsboy, and he has to keep looking
through the knot-hole to see our green house,” explained
Mary. “He might have seen you, but he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“We’re very sorry if we hurt you, funny boy,” said the
newsboy, sad like.</p>

<p>“Oh, pray do not mention it,” said the boy who had
stopped the drygoods box, as it was floating down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
street. “It was merely a little bump on my nose.” Then
he began to turn somersaults until he had somersaulted
through the papers on top, just as the circus man jumps
through a paper hoop, right inside the box where the
Trippertrot children were, and all of a sudden Mary
cried out:</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Jiggily Jig, the funny boy!”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course it is!” cried Tommy and Johnny.</p>

<p>“Not the least doubt of it,” said Jiggily Jig, who was
called that, you remember, because he was always dancing
a jig.</p>

<p>“But where did you leave Simple Simon?” asked Mary,
for the last they had seen of Jiggily Jig was when he was
running off with Simple Simon, after they had met the
pieman coming from the circus.</p>

<p>“Oh, Simple Simon has gone to work for the pieman,”
said Jiggily Jig. “He had to have pie so often that his
mother sent him there instead of after water in a sieve.
Now watch me,” and Jiggily Jig turned two somersaults,
one after another, and the drygoods box nearly upset, and
the rain came down harder than ever.</p>

<p>“Wait! Hold on!” cried the newsboy. “This will never
do! Do you know these children, Jiggily Jig?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I do,” answered the funny boy, “and I will
take them home, for they are lost. I know they are. They
are always lost; aren’t you?” and he looked at Mary and
Tommy and Johnny.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Trippertrot children, in a chorus, “we
are always lost.”</p>

<p>“But don’t worry, I will take you home,” said Jiggily
Jig, with a jolly laugh. “You are going the wrong way.
This boat must be turned around,” and with that he jumped
out, and turned a somersault in the water, turned the box<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
around, jumped in again, and the rain came down harder
than ever.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon be home!” cried Jiggily Jig. “We’ll soon
be at your green house,” and then the wind began to blow,
and Jiggily Jig made a sail out of the newspapers, put it
up on the edge of the box, with a piece of wood for a
mast, and away they went as fast as fast could be, sailing
in the drygoods box-ship.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, the wind began to blow harder than
ever, and the children were afraid that it might blow the
sail off their little ship.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that,” said Jiggily Jig. “I made
the sail good and strong. It won’t blow away.”</p>

<p>“But hadn’t you better look?” suggested Mary. “It would
be no fun to be sailing along without a sail.”</p>

<p>“I will look, just to oblige you,” spoke the funny boy.
“First I will do a little dance in here, and then I will peek
out to see if the sail is all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, kindly do not step on my toes, and wake me
up,” begged the newsboy, speaking in his sleep, for he had
stretched out on the bottom of the box, and was slumbering.</p>

<p>“Not for this whole world, and part of the moon,” answered
the funny boy. So he did his little dance, being
careful not to step on the newsboy’s toes, and then Jiggily
lifted up the papers, that were over the top of the box, and
looked out. Next he gave a cry:</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Mary, quickly.</p>

<p>“Are we at our house?” inquired Tommy, hopefully.</p>

<p>“Far, far from it,” replied Jiggily Jig, sadly. “Look
for yourselves, children,” and he took all the paper covering
off the top of the box, for it had stopped raining.</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Mary, as she looked out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“Oh! oh!” cried Tommy.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh!” exclaimed Johnny.</p>

<p>And well they might be surprised, for their boat had
been blown by the wind far away from the city streets,
where they had been sailing, and now they were away out
on a sort of lake, in a big green meadow. Off in the distance
were hills, with trees on them, and it was just like some
picture they had seen of a fairy boat sailing over a fairy
lake.</p>

<p>“Oh, where are we?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“I never saw this place before,” spoke Johnny.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” added Tommy.</p>

<p>“No matter where we are, it is a nice place,” went on
Jiggily Jig. “Wake up, newsboy, and see where we are.
There is no more rain, and you can’t get wet.”</p>

<p>So the newsboy stretched out his arms and his legs, and
he opened his mouth, and he opened his eyes, and then he
was awake, and he stood up to see what he could see.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is lovely!” he cried. “I always wanted to go
out to the country, and now I am here. This must be the
country, for it isn’t the city,” he added.</p>

<p>Then the box-ship sailed on farther and farther, over
the lake in the meadows, and the Trippertrots and the newsboy
and Jiggily Jig looked all about them, and were quite
happy.</p>

<p>Suddenly the wind blew them right toward a little
island, that was in the middle of the lake.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out here, and pretend we’re camping in the
woods,” suggested Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” cried Mary and Tommy. So they all got out
of the drygoods box, and landed on the island. It was a
nice island, with trees on, and some dry wood piled up in
a little cave near a place where there were some flat stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“I know what let’s do,” proposed Tommy. “Let’s make
a fireplace, and cook a dinner, just as if we were shipwrecked
sailors.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fine!” exclaimed Johnny.</p>

<p>“And I’ll wash the dishes,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t any dishes to wash,” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>“And nothing to cook at the fire, or even put on the
dishes, so there is no use washing them,” added his brother,
sorrowful like.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Mary. “But perhaps Jiggily Jig,
or the newsboy, has something we can cook.”</p>

<p>They both looked in their pockets, and the newsboy
shook his head.</p>

<p>“I have nothing,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I have!” cried Jiggily. “I have found some
apples. The pieman gave them to me the other day. They
will be fine to roast at the fire.”</p>

<p>Tommy and Johnny made the fire on the flat stones,
taking care not to burn themselves, and then, when there
were some hot embers ready, the apples were put down in
front of them, on the warm stones, and they began to roast—I
mean the apples roasted, not the stones, you understand.</p>

<p>“Oh, how lovely they smell!” exclaimed Mary, as Jiggily
turned the apples around with a sharp stick, so they
wouldn’t burn.</p>

<p>“Yes, they will soon be ready to eat,” said the funny
boy, and, surely enough, they were.</p>

<p>“But what shall we do for forks?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“A pointed stick will do for a knife and a fork, too,”
said the newsboy. “I’ve often eaten that way. You just
stick your roast apple on the point of the stick, and eat it.”</p>

<p>“What, eat the stick?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“No, eat the apple,” said the newsboy, laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“Well, the apples are roasted now, and you can eat
them,” said Jiggily, after a bit. So he whittled out a
pointed stick for everybody, and stuck an apple on each
one, and soon the travelers were sitting about the camp-fire,
eating the apples, and very good they were, too. I wish I
had one right this minute, but I’m not allowed to, you
know.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps we had better start off again,” suggested
Tommy, when the apples were eaten. “We must soon get
home, if we can.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jiggily.</p>

<p>“And we had better take some sticks, to use for oars, or
paddles, or to push ourselves along with, in case there is no
wind to blow the sail,” spoke Tommy. They all thought
this was a good plan, so the three Trippertrots, and the
newsboy, and Jiggily each got a tree branch.</p>

<p>Well, they climbed into the box-ship again, and Jiggily
pushed off from the island, and away they went sailing once
more. Then Jiggily and the newsboy stretched out on the
bottom of the box, where you couldn’t see them unless you
went up in a balloon, and they both went fast, fast to sleep.</p>

<p>On and on sailed the drygoods box, over the pretty lake,
over toward the hills with trees on them, until finally
Tommy said:</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s use our sticks to row with, and then we’ll go
faster. There isn’t much wind now, and we’re not going
along very quickly. Let’s push and row with the sticks.”</p>

<p>So they did that, and they went along very well. Only,
they had accidents. Sometimes Tommy’s hat would blow
off into the water, and he and Johnny would have to fish it
out with their stick-oars. And sometimes Johnny’s hat
would blow off, and he and his brother would have to
reach for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>And sometimes Tommy would reach for his own hat all
alone, and sometimes Johnny would have to fish up his own
hat all alone, when Tommy was attending to the sail. And
so it went on; when it wasn’t one thing it was another.</p>

<p>The newsboy and Jiggily Jig slept on, in the bottom of
the box, and they had a lovely time, with nothing to do.
And the Trippertrots had lots of fun, too, sailing away.</p>

<p>Sometimes it would rain, and they would put the papers
over the top of the box, and then the drops would stop
coming down, and they could take off the papers, stand up,
and paddle again.</p>

<p>On and on they went, and once the newsboy awakened,
and most unexpectedly he found some more molasses cookies
in his pocket, and he gave all his friends some, and some
he ate himself, and then he went to sleep again—he and
Jiggily.</p>

<p>Farther and farther they sailed—those Trippertrot
children, until, all of a sudden, Mary looked out from behind
the newspaper sail, and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, here we are back in the streets of the city again!
We are sailing in the gutters, just as we were before.”</p>

<p>“Sure enough, so we are!” said Tommy, and they really
were back where they had been, before they got out on the
little lake in the meadow. Then the wind blew on the sail,
and the box-ship went on and on, through the rain, which
came down pitter-patter again.</p>

<p>And a very funny thing happened soon after that.</p>

</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh, do</span> you think you will ever find our house?” asked
Mary, as she sat down on the bottom of the box, and ate
up the last crumbs of the molasses cookies which the newsboy
had given her and her brothers.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure we will!” exclaimed Jiggily Jig, suddenly
awakening.</p>

<p>“And will we be there soon?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“Very soon,” answered Jiggily Jig, trying to turn a
somersault inside the box. But there wasn’t room enough,
and Jiggily stepped on the newsboy’s toes.</p>

<p>“Ouch! Don’t do that, please!” cried the newsboy.
“Please don’t step on my toes.”</p>

<p>“Why, did I hurt you?” asked the funny boy.</p>

<p>“No, but you woke me up. I was asleep,” answered the
newsboy. “As long as you are captain of this box-ship I
know everything will go along all right, and you will get
the Trippertrots home safely, so I am going to sleep. But
I can’t sleep if you turn somersaults in here, and step on
my toes. Nobody could sleep when their toes were being
stepped on. I leave it to you, now; could they, children?”</p>

<p>“I don’t hardly think they could,” said Mary, politely,
for she did not want to make Jiggily Jig feel badly.</p>

<p>“And I’m not sure, as no one ever stepped on my toes
when I was asleep,” said Tommy, “but I think it must be
quite unpleasant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“There, you see how it is, Jiggily Jig!” exclaimed the
newsboy. “I’m quite right about it.”</p>

<p>“To be sure you are,” admitted Jiggily Jig. “I never
thought of it that way before. I’ll stop turning somersaults
directly. But may I dance a few jigs?” he asked, and he
made a polite bow to Mary, and also to Tommy and
Johnny, and the newsboy.</p>

<p>“Do you really <i>have</i> to dance?” the newsboy asked.
“Because if you don’t really <i>have</i> to, it might be just as
well not to. You might step on my toes again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I have to dance,” said Jiggily Jig, “or else I
would have to change my name to Joggily Jog, and I
wouldn’t like that at all. But I’ll tell you what I’ll do.
I’ll dance just a little bit, and I’ll take good care not to
step on anybody’s toes.”</p>

<p>So then and there, in the drygoods box-ship, Jiggily Jig
danced a nice dance, and as truly as I’m telling you, he
didn’t step even on his own toes. Oh, Jiggily was quite a
wonderful boy!</p>

<p>And, all this while the box-ship, with the paper sail,
was sailing down the street, which was filled with water
from the rain-storm. But none of the rain came inside,
because the newsboy had put more papers over the top of
the box to keep the wet outside.</p>

<p>“We don’t seem to be getting home very fast,” said
Johnny, after a while, “and I’m sure when we do get there,
we’ll be late for school.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so, too,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” spoke Jiggily Jig. “You can tell the
teacher all about what happened to you, and how you went
after the little fairy mouse, and then how you went sailing.
She will surely excuse you.”</p>

<p>“Maybe she will,” said Tommy. “But I wish we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
home, because I am hungry again. I wonder if the newsboy
has any more cookies in his pockets. I’m going to ask
him.”</p>

<p>“Hush! Don’t do that,” said Mary, softly, “for he is
asleep, and we ought not to wake him up.”</p>

<p>“But I am hungry,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Wait, I think I can look in his pockets without making
him wake up,” spoke Jiggily Jig, and he did so. But,
alas! there were no more cookies to be had.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Mary, “we will soon be home.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jiggily Jig, “I’ll look out of the knot-hole
in the box, and see if I can find your house.”</p>

<p>So Jiggily Jig did this, and all of a sudden he cried
out:</p>

<p>“Oh, joy! Oh, joy! Oh, joy!” three times, just like
that, he cried it.</p>

<p>“What! do you see our house?” asked Mary, and she
was so excited that she turned around and nearly stepped
on the toes of the newsboy, who was asleep—he was asleep,
and his toes were, too, I guess, just as, sometimes, your
foot goes to sleep when you sit on it. “Do you see our
house?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“No, but I can see that it has stopped raining again,”
answered Jiggily Jig. “Now we can sail along without
having the newspapers over the top of the box to keep out
the water. I’m real glad of that.”</p>

<p>So he took the papers off the top of the box again and
it sailed down the street for quite a distance, with the wind
blowing the paper sail as nicely as could be, and the Trippertrot
children thought they would soon be home. You
see, the newsboy’s papers had some wax on them, which the
kind honey-bees had put there, so the rain didn’t melt them.</p>

<p>“Will you please look again, Jiggily Jig,” asked Tommy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
“and see if you can find our house now? It’s painted
green, you know.”</p>

<p>So Jiggily Jig looked out of the knot-hole in the side of
the box, and all at once he cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, joy! I see something green. That must be your
house. Get ready now, the boat is going to land,” and he
was so excited that he turned a somersault without thinking,
and came down on the toes of the sleeping newsboy.</p>

<p>“Oh! Ouch! Oh, my!” cried the newsboy, as he woke
up. “What has happened?”</p>

<p>“I saw something green. It’s the house of the Trippertrots!”
cried Jiggily, as he danced a little jig. “Forgive
me for stepping on your toes,” he said to the newsboy,
politely. “I was so excited that I could not help it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is all right,” answered the newsboy, kindly.
“As long as I can be sure that these children get safely
home I don’t much care what happens. May I see the
house?”</p>

<p>“Yes, look through this hole,” said Jiggily Jig, and he
pointed to the one in the side of the box. “You will see
something green,” he went on, “and that must be the home
of the Trippertrots.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t have to look through the hole,” said the
newsboy. “As long as the rain isn’t coming down any
more, I can look out of the top of the box, and I can see
better.”</p>

<p>So he stood up, and looked at the green thing that Jiggily
Jig had seen, and then, all of a sudden, the newsboy
cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! What a disappointment! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“Why, whatever is the matter?” asked Mary, surprised
like.</p>

<p>“Oh, that isn’t your house at all,” went on the newsboy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“Why, it’s green; isn’t it?” asked Jiggily Jig.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s green,” said the newsboy.</p>

<p>“Well, the Trippertrot house is green,” answered Jiggily
Jig.</p>

<p>“I know, but just you take a look at this,” invited the
newsboy. “Why, that green thing you saw was a man with
a whole lot of toy, green balloons, such as you see in the
circus. And he is coming this way with them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody!” cried Tommy Trippertrot, “maybe he will
give us some, and we can have a lot of fun with them.”</p>

<p>“Have you got any money?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“No,” said Tommy, sorrowfully, “I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Then you can’t get any toy balloons,” spoke his
brother.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Jiggily Jig, or the newsboy, would lend us a
little money, until we can get some of our own when we
reach home,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes,” spoke the newsboy. “I will lend you as much as
you need.”</p>

<p>Then the man with the toy, green balloons came closer
to the drygoods box-ship, and he caught hold of it, and
stopped it from sailing any farther, and he sang this little
song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Toy balloons! Oh, toy balloons!</div>
<div class="verse">They sail as high as silver moons!</div>
<div class="verse">If you a toy balloon will buy,</div>
<div class="verse">You may sail up into the sky.</div>
<div class="verse">Toy balloon! Oh, toy balloon!</div>
<div class="verse">Please to buy one very soon.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“We would like to buy one,” said Mary, politely. “How
much are they, if you please?”</p>

<p>“They are a banana and two oranges apiece,” said the
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“No, she means how much money do they cost,” explained
Tommy.</p>

<p>“You can get them for ten cents in the circus,” said
Johnny. “I know, for my papa once bought me one.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but these are very different,” said the man. “They
are colored green, and they are much larger and stronger
than the circus balloons. Why, if I had enough green
balloons I could lift an elephant with them. That’s why
I don’t sell them for money. I want a banana and two
oranges for each balloon.”</p>

<p>“Then we can’t have any,” said Mary, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you can,” exclaimed Jiggily Jig. “I have just
the very thing.” Then he put his hands in his pockets, and
pulled out a lot of bananas and oranges. “I forgot I had
them,” he said, with a laugh, as he tossed them to the man.</p>

<p>Then the man gave Mary a big toy, green balloon, and
he gave one to Tommy, and one to Johnny. And then a
very strange thing happened. All at once Mary found herself
rising up in the air. Up and up she floated, for the
balloon lifted her, just as an airship would have done.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Don’t get excited,” said the balloon man, kindly. “Hold
on tight, and you will soon be home. The balloons will
take you there.”</p>

<p>Then Johnny and Tommy began to float up into the air
also, holding fast to the strings of their big toy balloons,
and Mary held on to the string of hers, too, and there the
three little Trippertrots were, sailing away just as if they
were in airships.</p>

<p>And, down below them, looking up, was Jiggily Jig,
and the newsboy, and the toy balloon man, standing near
the box-ship.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” called Jiggily Jig, waving his hand to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
children. “I’ll see you again soon.” Then the man and
the newsboy waved their hands, and Mary and Tommy
and Johnny went floating softly off, blown by a gentle wind.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t this the most surprising adventure!” exclaimed
Mary.</p>

<p>“It’s jolly fun!” declared Tommy.</p>

<p>“I think so, too,” added Johnny. “It’s nicer to go home
this way than in a box-ship.”</p>

<p>So they floated on for quite some time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER FOUR<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS’ THANKSGIVING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">We must</span> be careful to keep together,” said Mary to
her brothers, as they floated along, carried by the balloons.
“It would be dreadful if we lost each other.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re lost, anyhow,” said Tommy. “We’re always
getting lost, it seems to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is so,” admitted Johnny, “but Mary is right.
We must try to keep together. I don’t want to float off all
by myself alone.”</p>

<p>“And I guess I don’t, either,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“But the funny part of it is that we can’t walk when
we’re up in the air this way,” said Mary. “If the wind
happens to blow me away from you boys, or if it blows
you boys away from me, why, we can’t walk back again.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked Tommy, politely. “We
haven’t tried it yet. I’m going to see if I can walk in the
air.”</p>

<p>And, would you ever believe it if I didn’t tell you?
Why, that boy Tommy just wiggled his feet, as if he was
walking on the ground, you know, and he kept tight hold
of the string of the balloon, and my goodness sakes alive
and the pancake turner! There he was, walking along,
just as if he was on the sidewalk. Only it was ever so much
easier, you know.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can do it! I can do it!” cried Tommy, in delight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
“You do it, Mary and Johnny. Come up here where
I am.”</p>

<p>“All right, wait for us,” spoke his sister. “Don’t get too
far ahead, or we might not be able to catch up to you.”</p>

<p>So Tommy stopped walking in the air, and then Mary
and Johnny wiggled their feet, and as true as I’m telling
you, they, also, could move along, the balloons holding
them up as easily as an airship could have done.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is great fun!” cried Johnny.</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s look down and see how high up we are,” said
Tommy.</p>

<p>So Mary and Johnny and Tommy looked down, and
surely enough, they were almost as high as the church
steeple. They were floating along over the trees, and the
roofs of the houses, and the people walking along in the
streets below them didn’t even know that the three little
Trippertrots were away up over their heads in the air.</p>

<p>“Oh, suppose we should ever fall!” exclaimed Mary,
shivering like.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Tommy. “You mustn’t suppose anything
of the kind.”</p>

<p>“Especially as the man said these were very strong balloons,”
put in Johnny. “They can lift an elephant, and
we’re not as heavy even as a baby elephant.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” said Mary. “But I am just wondering
what will happen when we get over our house, if we
ever do. How are we going to get down to see papa and
mamma? It won’t be any fun for us to be up in the air,
and have them down on the ground, or in the house.
Maybe we can talk to them, but they can’t hold us in their
arms and—and——”</p>

<p>“And they can’t reach up, and give us anything to eat,”
exclaimed Tommy, sorrowfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Oh, yes, they can!” cried Johnny.</p>

<p>“How?” asked Tommy and Mary together, real excited
like.</p>

<p>“Why, they can put up a ladder, and reach us that way,
or we can go down the ladder,” said the little Trippertrot
boy.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” admitted Tommy. “I didn’t think of
that. I wonder when we will be home? We must keep
looking down until we see our house.”</p>

<p>So the three children walked on, by wiggling their legs
in the air, and they looked down to see if they could pick
out their green house, but they couldn’t seem to find it.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, there was a flutter of wings
and a whole lot of sparrows flew around them.</p>

<p>“Oh, see the birds!” cried Mary. “I guess they must
take us for birds, too. Oh, I wish I could fly!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would be nice,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“But this is almost as good as flying,” spoke Johnny.
“Especially when you wiggle your legs very fast. See, I
can almost catch up to the birds,” and he made his legs go
as if he was running, and, surely enough, he fairly whizzed
through the air, and Mary and Tommy had to run to catch
up to him.</p>

<p>Then the sparrows flew away, and the children kept on
floating over the roofs of the houses, and they looked down
at the people in the streets, and they were wondering when
they would be home, when, all at once, Tommy cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, see that big bird flying along!”</p>

<p>Down below the Trippertrot children was a large bird,
flapping its broad wings.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s an eagle,” said Johnny, who had seen a
picture of one in his bird and animal book, once upon a
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“I wish it would come up here closer, where we could
see it,” spoke Mary. “I like eagles.”</p>

<p>And then, all at once, the big bird opened its beak, and
it cried out:</p>

<p>“Gobble-obble-obble!” just like that.</p>

<p>“Why!” exclaimed Tommy. “That’s not an eagle.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s a turkey gobbler,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“And look!” cried Mary. “It’s flying right down toward
that house with the red roof.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” suddenly cried Tommy, wiggling his little
fat legs. “I know where we are now. That house with the
red roof is ours.”</p>

<p>“But our house is painted green,” objected Mary.</p>

<p>“The sides of it are green, but the top is red,” said
Tommy. “I know, ’cause when the men were painting our
house the one who was on the roof spilled some of his
paint, and it fell on the end of my nose, and it was red.”</p>

<p>“What was red, the paint or your nose?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“My nose was red after the red paint fell on it,” said
Tommy. “That’s how I know that the roof of our house is
red.”</p>

<p>“But there are other red roofs besides ours,” spoke
Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, but there’s another reason why I know that is our
house,” went on Tommy.</p>

<p>“How?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“Because that turkey gobbler went in there. I heard
Suzette, our nursemaid, say this morning that we were going
to have turkey for Thanksgiving. To-day is Thanksgiving,
and there goes the turkey into a house with a red
roof, and our house has a red roof, so that’s our home.
Oh, how glad I am! Come on, we must wiggle ourselves
until we get right over the top of it, and then we can call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
out, and papa and mamma will come out with the step-ladder,
and get us.”</p>

<p>So the children walked along through the air, holding
to the strings of their toy, green balloons, until they were
right over their house. Then they all cried out together,
as loudly as they could:</p>

<p>“Papa! Mammal Here we are! Up in the air! Come
and get us!”</p>

<p>A minute later Mr. and Mrs. Trippertrot ran out on
the balcony over the front porch and looked up. There
they saw their children.</p>

<p>“Oh, my darlings!” cried their mamma, waving her hand
to them. “I thought I should never see you again! However
did you get up there?”</p>

<p>“We got lost this morning, chasing after the fairy
mouse,” said Mary, “and the balloon man sold Jiggily Jig,
the funny boy, these balloons, and they took us up, and the
turkey showed us which was our house, so we’re home
again.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it!” said their papa. “But why don’t you
come down?”</p>

<p>“We can’t, the balloons hold us up,” said Johnny, and
he and Tommy tried to pull themselves down, but they
couldn’t, because the balloons were so strong.</p>

<p>“You must get a ladder and reach it up to us, and then
we can let go of the balloons, and walk down,” said Mary.</p>

<p>So Mr. Trippertrot was hurrying away to get the ladder
when Suzette, the maid, said:</p>

<p>“Oh, I know a better way than that. If Miss Mary has
a pin she can just make a little pin-hole in her balloon and
also in Master Johnny’s and Tommy’s, and let out a little
of the gas from the green balloons, and then the children
will float safely down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“That is a good way,” said Mr. Trippertrot, so he
called to Mary to do that. Very carefully she made little
holes in the three balloons, and, in another minute, the
Trippertrot children were safely down on the balcony over
the front porch of their house, and their papa and mamma
were hugging and kissing them.</p>

<p>“And you must never go away again,” said their
mamma.</p>

<p>“We won’t,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Is the Thanksgiving dinner ready?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“For we are very hungry,” spoke Johnny.</p>

<p>“It is nearly ready,” said Suzette.</p>

<p>And then, pretty soon, the Trippertrot family sat down
to a fine Thanksgiving dinner. There was turkey and
cranberry sauce, and oysters, and celery, and nuts, and
cake, and oranges, and figs, and cookies, and oh! ever so
many things. I can’t remember half of them.</p>

<p>But the Trippertrots were careful not to eat too much,
as that isn’t proper, and, besides, it makes you ill. So they
ate just enough, and they had a fine time afterward playing
many kinds of games.</p>

<p>And then—oh, well, I guess you had better look at the
next story, to see what happened afterward.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER FIVE<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS IN A GROCERY WAGON</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, what game shall we play now?” asked Mary
Trippertrot, of her brothers Johnny and Tommy, when
they had finished playing the one called “Please Don’t
Step on My Toes.” It was a game Mary made up herself,
and was very nice.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” answered Tommy. “Suppose we
play ‘Hide the Knitting Needle’?”</p>

<p>“That’s no fun!” exclaimed Johnny. “Besides, some of
us might get stuck by the needle.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Mary. “But what can we do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know!” cried Tommy. “We’ll play that nice old
game of looking out of the window and choosing things.
We’ll let Mary have first choice, and maybe she can get
an automobile.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodie!” exclaimed the little Trippertrot girl.
“Then we can go for a ride in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but mamma said we weren’t to go out of the
house, unless something special, extra-extraordinary happened,”
spoke Tommy, “so we couldn’t go out in your
auto, Mary, even if you are lucky enough to get one.”</p>

<p>“But I only meant to take a <i>make-believe</i> ride in a
<i>make-believe</i> auto,” explained the little girl. “Wouldn’t
that be all right?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“I guess it would,” said Johnny. “Anyhow, let’s go to
the window, look out, and see what things we can choose.”</p>

<p>So that is how the three little Trippertrots happened
to be looking out of the window. And, as truly as I’m
telling you, the first thing that came along was a great big
red automobile, with large, fat wheels, like sausages, and
Mary cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s mine! That’s mine!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tommy, “and now let’s go for a make-believe
ride in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but first let’s you and I choose something,” said
Johnny to his brother.</p>

<p>“There comes a horse and carriage,” said Tommy. “I’m
going to choose that for mine.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t take that in my auto,” said Mary. “It’s
far too big.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” agreed Tommy. “Wait a minute, there
comes a messenger boy with a box of candy. I’ll choose
that.”</p>

<p>“Which, the boy or the candy?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“The candy, of course!” exclaimed Tommy, with a
laugh. “There might not be room in the auto for the
boy.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’d better be quick about what you’re going
to choose, Johnny!” called Mary, “for my red auto is moving
along pretty fast, and it may be out of our block before
we get our ride in it. Hurry up, Johnny.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll choose that fruit-stand across the street,”
spoke Johnny.</p>

<p>“That’s nice,” said Mary. “We shan’t be hungry on our
trip, anyhow, with Tommy’s box of candy, and Johnny’s
fruit-stand. Come on, now, get in my auto.”</p>

<p>So the boys made-believe help their sister into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
make-believe auto, and they closed the doors and turned on
the gasolene, and away they went as fast as anything, if you
will kindly believe me. Only, of course, it was only make-believe,
pretend riding, you know.</p>

<p>They went to New York, and a place called Osh-Kosh,
and to Mumbly-Bumbly and to Kalamazoo and even part
way to the moon, but, of course, all this while they were
really only in the front room of their house, peeping out of
the window.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, Mary looked, and she saw a
grocery wagon on the street, out in front, and the horse
hitched to the wagon was walking slowly along, and there
was no one driving him.</p>

<p>“Look at that!” cried Mary. “That horse is running
away.”</p>

<p>“I guess you mean he’s <i>walking</i> away,” said Johnny.
“He isn’t running.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s going away, anyhow,” insisted Mary, “and
the driver isn’t there and the horse may bunk the wagon
into something, and smash it, and then the grocery man
would lose a lot of money.”</p>

<p>“Well, what can we do about it?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“We might go out, and stop the horse from going
away,” continued Mary, “and then we could telephone to
the man who owns it, to come and get it from in front of
our house.”</p>

<p>Johnny looked all around the room. So did Tommy.
Their papa and mamma weren’t there. Neither was the
nursemaid.</p>

<p>“Do you think going out to stop the horse would be a
special, extra-extraordinary occasion?” asked Tommy, of
Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45-46]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_045">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_045.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>“Whoa There, Horsie!” She Called</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she said, “I do. And I think if mamma was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>here she’d want us to go out of the house to catch the walk-away
grocery wagon and horse.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll do it,” decided Tommy. “Come on, Mary
and Johnny!”</p>

<p>So out of the house the three little Trippertrots went
after the grocery wagon, and they never stopped to think
that they might get lost again. They wanted to do a kind
act, you see, and I think it was very nice of them; don’t
you?</p>

<p>They ran after the walk-away horse, that was now some
distance down the street, and soon the Trippertrots had
caught up to him.</p>

<p>“Whoa, horsie!” called Tommy.</p>

<p>“Yes, you must stop,” added Johnny, most politely.</p>

<p>“Because it’s wrong to run away, or even walk away,”
said Mary. “We came to catch you, so your master can
find you. Otherwise, you might get lost, you know.”</p>

<p>“Horses can’t get lost!” declared Tommy.</p>

<p>“They might, when they were little girl or boy horses,”
said Mary. “I should think a little horse could get lost,
the same as we do, lots of times. Whoa there, horsie!” she
called, for the grocery horse was still walking away.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps ponies can get lost,” admitted Tommy,
and just then the grocery horse stood still, because the
three Trippertrot children had run out right in front of
him. I think it was very brave of them; don’t you?</p>

<p>The horse looked at the children, and the Trippertrots
looked at the horse, and then Mary said:</p>

<p>“Now we ought to tie him to a post, so he can’t get
away any farther, and then go telephone to the man.
Otherwise, we might get lost ourselves.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t know who owns the horse,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is his name on the side of the wagon,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Johnny, and, surely enough, there was the grocery man’s
name in big letters.</p>

<p>“What name do you think it is?” asked Mary, of her
brothers.</p>

<p>“Oh, how funny of us!” exclaimed Tommy. “None of
us can read, because we’re only in the kindergarten class,
so we can’t tell what the name is on the wagon.”</p>

<p>“I can read!” cried Johnny. “I can read words like
‘cat’ and ‘dog.’”</p>

<p>“But I don’t think the grocery man’s name is either cat
or dog,” spoke Mary.</p>

<p>“Then what are we going to do?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“We can tie the horse to a post,” said Mary, “and then
we can go home and tell papa about it, and he can come
and read the name for us.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” declared Tommy. “But what
shall we use to tie the horse to a post? Have you a piece
of string in your pocket, Johnny?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered his brother, “I have.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you silly boys!” exclaimed Mary. “They don’t tie
horses with string. They use a leather strap. There must
be one in the wagon. You boys climb in and look.”</p>

<p>So Tommy and Johnny climbed up on the wagon step,
and crawled back over the seat, for the horse was kind
and gentle, and stood very still, looking up at the sky now
and then, to see if it would rain, I guess.</p>

<p>“I can’t find any strap!” called Johnny, after a while.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” added Tommy. “There are a lot of groceries
in the wagon, but no strap.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose I’ll have to look myself,” said Mary.
So she climbed up into the wagon where her brothers were.
She looked in among the boxes and baskets, and she had
just found the strap, which was in among some oranges,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
when, all at once, a queer thing happened. The horse
suddenly started to walk away again, pulling the wagon
after him, and the Trippertrot children were in the wagon.
So, of course, the horse pulled them, too.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Mary. “We’re having a ride!”</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” exclaimed Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, but we mustn’t!” shouted Tommy. “The horse is
taking us away from home, and mamma told us not to go!
We must stop him!”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted his brother.</p>

<p>“Whoa there! Whoa! Whoa!” called Mary to the horse.
But the horse wouldn’t stop, and kept on going, taking the
Trippertrot children farther and farther down the street.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall we do?” asked Mary, of her brothers.
“We will be lost again.”</p>

<p>“I guess we will,” spoke Johnny, but he didn’t seem to
mind it very much.</p>

<p>“Can’t you pull on the lines and make the horse stop?”
asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“The lines are too far out,” answered Johnny. “I might
fall if I reached for them.”</p>

<p>“Then call to some one—a policeman or anybody—and
ask him to please stop the horse,” suggested Mary. “Oh,
boys! this time it isn’t our fault that we’re running away;
is it?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” answered Tommy. “But the horse isn’t
running, he is only walking. Maybe he’ll stop soon.”</p>

<p>“He’s running now,” suddenly exclaimed Johnny, and,
surely enough, the horse began to go faster and faster,
giving the Trippertrots a nice ride, but still taking them
farther and farther away from home.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re lost again!” cried Mary, as she and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
brothers sat down in the back of the wagon, in among the
boxes and baskets of groceries. “I wonder where we will
end up?”</p>

<p>But none of the children seemed to know, so they just
sat there in the wagon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER SIX<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE POOR FAMILY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Where</span> do you suppose this horse is going?” asked
Mary, of her brothers, after a while.</p>

<p>“Home, I guess,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to his home, or our home?” asked
Johnny. “Because, if he goes to our home, it’s all right,
but if the horse goes to his own home, why—why——”</p>

<p>“We’ll be lost again, that’s all,” said Tommy, simply.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re lost now,” cried Mary, as she looked out of
the front of the wagon. “We’re on a strange street, that I
never saw before, and I don’t know how far from home.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll get back some time,” said Johnny, “so we
don’t need to worry about it. We always do get home,
somehow or other, and perhaps we’ll have another funny
adventure, like being carried up into the air by the
balloons.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish we would!” exclaimed Tommy. “Anyhow,
I’m hungry, and if an adventure is going to happen I wish
it would be one with something to eat in it.”</p>

<p>“What! You don’t mean to say you are hungry so soon
after our big Thanksgiving-turkey-dinner, do you?” asked
Mary Trippertrot.</p>

<p>“Yes, I—I guess I am,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“And so am I!” exclaimed Johnny. “But I know where
I can get something to eat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Where? Oh, tell me where!” cried Tommy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Right in this wagon,” said Johnny. “It’s full of groceries,
and we can eat some of them. There are oranges,
and I saw some nuts, and some candy, and some crackers,
and cheese and—and—oh, there is plenty to eat.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t ours,” objected Mary, quickly, “and we
mustn’t take what isn’t ours.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s so,” said Johnny, sadly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know how we can fix it,” spoke Tommy. “We
can take what we want—not too much, of course—and we
can keep account of it, and when we find the man who
owns the grocery wagon we can ask papa to pay him for
what we took. I’m sure he will.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess he will,” agreed Johnny.</p>

<p>“Besides,” added Mary, “the grocery man might give
us some pennies for stopping his horse from running away,
and we could pay him back with those.”</p>

<p>“Yes, only but we’re <i>not</i> stopping his horse from running
away,” said Tommy, “for he <i>is</i> running as fast as he
can.”</p>

<p>And the horse was, but he was on a smooth asphalt
street, and the wagon went so easily that the children didn’t
notice how very fast they were going.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he wouldn’t stop if I asked him please
to?” spoke Mary, as she leaned over the seat.</p>

<p>“You might try,” suggested Johnny.</p>

<p>So Mary did.</p>

<p>“Oh, please, nice horsie, won’t you kindly stop running
away with us?” she asked, in her gentle voice. “We don’t
want to get so far away from home, and it will soon be
dark. Please stop.”</p>

<p>But the horse only wiggled his ears backwards and forwards,
switched his tail to and fro, and kept on going.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“It’s no use!” exclaimed Tommy. “He won’t stop, and
I’m going to eat.”</p>

<p>“So am I!” added Johnny.</p>

<p>“Then I suppose I may as well, also,” said Mary. “But
we must remember all that we take, so papa can pay the
grocery man, or we can pay him, if he gives us any
pennies.”</p>

<p>So the children each took an orange, out of a basket
that had a great many in it, and they took some nuts, and
a little candy, and some grapes, and then Mary opened a
big package and she cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, boys! Look here!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Johnny. “Is Jiggily Jig there?”</p>

<p>“No, but see! It’s a fine big turkey, all ready to put in
the oven,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“And look at the stalks of celery!” shouted Johnny, as
he opened another package.</p>

<p>“And see the bunches of white grapes!” exclaimed
Tommy.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said Mary, solemnly, “I see what this is.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“It is Somebody’s Thanksgiving dinner,” said Mary.
“That is just what it is. And, oh, I wonder whose it is?
The horse is running away with us, and with the dinner,
and I suppose some one is hungry for it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not hungry—not now,” remarked Johnny, as
he ate another orange.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” added Tommy, as he cracked some more nuts.
“But I was a while ago.”</p>

<p>“I’m not hungry, either,” said Mary; “but, boys, I just
wish we could find the family that needed this dinner.”</p>

<p>“Let’s look out along the street, and maybe we’ll see
some one who is hungry,” suggested Tommy. So they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
looked out, but they didn’t see any one, not even a policeman.
For it was still Thanksgiving Day, you remember,
and I suppose all the people were still in their houses,
perhaps sleeping after their dinners, or maybe they were
at the football game, or the theatre. Anyhow, there wasn’t
a soul to be seen.</p>

<p>“We can’t ask any one,” said Mary, with a sigh. “There’s
no one to ask.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps the horse knows where the dinner belongs,
and he’ll go there,” spoke Johnny. “He looked to me
like a very smart horse.”</p>

<p>“And, maybe after he takes the dinner where it belongs,
he’ll take us back home,” went on Tommy.</p>

<p>“Oh, that would be lovely if he would,” exclaimed
Mary.</p>

<p>So the children sat in the back of the grocery wagon,
with the boxes and baskets, and the horse kept going faster
and faster on the asphalt street, and the Trippertrots didn’t
know where they would get to finally, when, all at once,
the horse turned off the asphalt, and began pulling the
wagon over the cobblestones.</p>

<p>Rattlety-bang! Rattlety-bang! it went, and the children
were all shaken up, and then, all at once, the horse stopped.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re somewhere!” exclaimed Mary. “I’m glad
of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I wonder where we are?” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>“Can it be our house?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“No, there are no cobblestones in front of our house,”
replied Mary, quickly.</p>

<p>Johnny looked out of the front of the wagon. He saw a
little house, not very nice looking, for it was rather ragged,
as if it needed a new suit of clothes, and the chimney was
almost falling off the roof, and the fence in front was full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
of holes, and, altogether, it was a very pretty sort of a house
indeed.</p>

<p>“What is there?” asked Mary, of her brother.</p>

<p>“This is the place where the Thanksgiving dinner belongs,
I guess,” said Johnny. “The horse stopped here of
his own accord, so it must be the place.”</p>

<p>“Then, as long as the grocery boy isn’t here, we had
better carry the things in,” suggested Tommy. “We can
make-believe we are the grocery boys.”</p>

<p>“I can’t be a boy,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“No, you’ll have to be a grocery girl,” spoke Tommy.
“But that will be all right. I’ll take the turkey, ’cause I’m
the strongest.”</p>

<p>“I wish Jiggily Jig, or Simple Simon, or the nice newsboy
was here to help us,” spoke Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, we can do it all right,” said his brother. And
then, while the kind horse stood very still, the three Trippertrots
took the Thanksgiving things out of the wagon,
and marched up to the shabby-looking house with them.
Tommy put the big turkey down on the step, and knocked
at the door.</p>

<p>A poor-looking woman opened it, and behind her the
Trippertrots could see a whole lot of hungry-looking children.
Oh! how very hungry they were!</p>

<p>“Well, what is it, please?” asked the woman, as she
looked at Tommy and Johnny and Mary Trippertrot.</p>

<p>“If—if you please,” spoke Tommy, as he lifted up the
big turkey to her, “here is your Thanksgiving dinner.”</p>

<p>“My Thanksgiving dinner!” exclaimed the woman, and
a few teardrops came into her eyes, while Mary could
hear the hungry children, who were standing behind her,
sort of gasping, and making their tongues go around inside
their mouths. “My Thanksgiving dinner!” said the woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
again. “Bless your dear little heart, I’m not going to have
any Thanksgiving dinner. We—we’re too poor!” she said.
“There must be some mistake. You are at the wrong house.
Thanksgiving dinner! Why—why, I haven’t had a real
Thanksgiving dinner since I was a little girl,” and she
turned around to look at her poor little children standing
behind her.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re going to have one now,” said Mary Trippertrot.
“This is yours.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” exclaimed the woman. “You are at the
wrong house.”</p>

<p>“It <i>can’t</i> be the wrong house!” cried Johnny. “The
grocery horse stopped here himself, and I guess he knows
where the dinner belongs. Let’s take it in, Tommy and
Mary.”</p>

<p>So into the house went the Trippertrots, carrying the
Thanksgiving dinner. Oh, what a dinner it was! There
were oranges, and apples, and nuts, and candy, and white
grapes, and bread, and butter, and potatoes, and the big
turkey, of course; and celery, and cranberries, and some
cookies and cakes, and, oh! I couldn’t tell you what else
there was! The table was piled quite full.</p>

<p>“Are you sure it’s for us?” asked the poor woman. “I
don’t think we ought to keep it.”</p>

<p>“Oh—oh, mamma!” cried one of the poor little girls—and
there were about four boys and seven girls in that
poor family—“oh, mamma—don’t—don’t—<i>please</i> don’t
send it away. We are <i>so</i> hungry.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed Johnny, as he looked out of the
window, “you can’t send it away if you wanted to—not
now.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked the woman.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57-58]</span>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_057">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_057.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>The Trippertrots Carrying the Thanksgiving
Dinner</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Because the grocery horse has run away again,” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Johnny. “I guess he knew what he was doing
when he left the dinner here, and now he’s gone back
home. So you can’t send the dinner away. You’ve got to
keep it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bless your dear hearts, we will,” said the woman,
and, oh! how happy those children were—the poor ones I
mean. But, of course, the Trippertrots were happy, too,
because they had done a kindness.</p>

<p>Then the poor woman began to cook the Thanksgiving
dinner, and she put the turkey in the oven to roast nice and
brown, and the Trippertrots were helping her when, all of
a sudden, there came a loud knock on the door of the
house where the poor family lived.</p>

<p>“Ha! I wonder who that can be?” asked the poor
woman.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s our papa come for us,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“Who are you, and where do you live?” asked the poor
woman.</p>

<p>“We are the Trippertrots, but we don’t know where we
live, if you please,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Because we are lost—we are always getting lost,”
added Tommy. “But perhaps some one has come for us.”</p>

<p>So the poor woman went to the door, and there stood a
boy with a white apron on.</p>

<p>“Ah, I’ve found you at last!” he said, when he saw the
Trippertrots. “I’m the grocery boy and I’ve been looking
all over for you and the wagon.”</p>

<p>“We’re here, but the horse and wagon are gone,” replied
Mary.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind,” said the grocery boy, as he waved
his white apron. “Come with me, if you please.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER SEVEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE GROCERY BOY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, aren’t you coming with me?” asked the grocery
boy, as Tommy stood staring at him. As for Mary, she
was looking in the oven, to see if the turkey was cooking,
and it was turning the loveliest brown color you could
imagine. And Johnny Trippertrot was playing spin tops
with one of the boys of the poor family. So, you see,
Tommy was the only one the grocery boy could look at, or
talk to.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you children coming with me?” asked the grocery
boy again, after a bit.</p>

<p>“Where do you want us to go?” inquired Tommy.</p>

<p>“Why, anywhere you’d like to go,” replied the grocery
boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, then can you take us home?” begged Mary,
eagerly, as she opened the oven door, and shut it again,
and then the whole kitchen of the poor family was filled
with the nicest cooking-smell—just like Christmas and
Thanksgiving rolled into one, you know.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I can take you home,” said the grocery
boy. “But how did you get so far away, and are you lost,
as usual?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we are lost, the same as we always are,” replied
Johnny, as he gave the top to the poor boy to spin. “But
we wouldn’t have been in this trouble only the horse first
walked away with us and then he ran.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“What horse?” asked the grocery boy.</p>

<p>“The horse that drew us here, with the Thanksgiving
dinner,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“It must have been your horse,” put in Mary. “You
said you had been looking for one, and I think this was
yours. And I hope we delivered the Thanksgiving dinner
to the right place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, s’posin’ we haven’t!” gasped Johnny. “We’ll have
to ask papa to pay for it for us.”</p>

<p>Then Mary told how they had looked out of the window
of their home, and had seen the grocery horse walking
away with no one on the seat to hold on to the lines, and
how they had gotten in the wagon and been drawn along
until they got to the house where the poor family lived.</p>

<p>“And,” said Mary, “we saw the Thanksgiving dinner in
the wagon, and, as the horse stopped here, we thought it
belonged in this house. But if we have make a mistake——”</p>

<p>“Oh, that would be terrible!” exclaimed Tommy.</p>

<p>“Indeed, it would!” said Johnny. And, at this thought,
the poor children, who had been sniffing the smell of the
roast turkey, and who had been looking at the nuts, and the
cranberries, and the oysters, and oranges, and candy, and
grapes, and celery, and other good things that the Trippertrot
children had brought—at this thought, I say—fearing
that their nice dinner might be taken away, the poor children
nearly cried. And their mamma looked worried, too.</p>

<p>But you just wait and hear what the grocery boy said.
He looked first at Mary, and then at Johnny, and then at
Tommy.</p>

<p>“It was no mistake at all,” said the grocery boy, as he
waved his white apron like a flag. “That dinner belonged
just here, and here it stays. The grocery man I work for
is very kind, and he put up a big Thanksgiving dinner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and told me to take it to some poor family. I started out
with it, but I saw a poor little doggie, with a tin can tied
to his tail.</p>

<p>“So I got out of my wagon to take off the can, and
then my horse, that was fastened to the grocery wagon,
started off. It must have been then that you children tried
to stop him, and I’m much obliged to you. So you see,
the horse knew just where to stop, and the Thanksgiving
dinner stays right here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad!” cried the poor woman.</p>

<p>“And so are we,” said the poor children.</p>

<p>Then Mary Trippertrot looked in the oven again, and
as soon as she opened the stove door out came that nice
smell once more, and really it almost makes me hungry to
tell you about it.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it’s time we started away,” said the
grocery boy, after a while.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you are going to take us home; aren’t you?”
asked Mary, as she went up to him, and took hold of his
hand, for he was a very nice, kind, gentle grocery boy, and
whenever he delivered eggs, he never broke one, he was so
careful.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll take you home,” he said to Mary and Johnny
and Tommy. “Come along.”</p>

<p>“Oh, must you really go?” asked the poor woman. “I
wish, after you have been so kind to us, that you could
stay and have some of this lovely turkey dinner.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do stay!” cried all the poor children together, like
a lot of twins, you know, only, of course, they weren’t.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you,” said Mary, politely, “we have had our
dinner, and really we must get back home before dark, or
mamma and papa will worry about us. We shouldn’t have
come out, only it was a special, extra-extraordinary occasion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
like the time of the dancing bears, and the pink cow,
otherwise we never would have come out.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s start if we’re going to,” said Tommy. So
they all said good-by to the poor family, and went out into
the street, Mary holding the grocery boy’s right hand, and
Tommy his left hand, and Johnny held hold of Mary’s
other hand, so they all had hold of hands, you see.</p>

<p>“Now which way had we better go?” asked the grocery
boy, when they stood out on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Oh, the shortest way,” said Mary. “We want to get
home as soon as we can.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think that would be a good plan,” spoke the
grocery boy, “so if you will show me the shortest way to
your house, we’ll take it.”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know the shortest way?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the grocery boy, “I can’t say that I do.
You see, I haven’t lived in this part of the city very long,
and I don’t know my way about very well. So you can
easily see that I don’t know the shortest way to your
house.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I suppose we will have to go the longest
way home,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“It won’t matter so much,” went on his brother. “For
if we go the longest way we may meet with an adventure,
and we might not if we went the short way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that would be fine!” exclaimed Mary. “Yes, grocery
boy, please take us home the longest way.”</p>

<p>The grocery boy took off his cap, and scratched first
his nose, and then his left ear. Then he waved his white
apron like a flag, and he seemed to be thinking very
deeply, just as some children do when they have to spell a
hard word in school.</p>

<p>“Well, to tell you the truth, as I always do,” said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
grocery boy, “I don’t believe I even know which is the
longest way to your house, to say nothing of the shortest
way.”</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” spoke Tommy. “What can we do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have it!” suddenly cried Mary. “He can take
us home the middle way. Don’t you remember the story
of the three bears? The little bear couldn’t sleep in the
big bed, and the big bear couldn’t sleep in the little bed,
but the middle-sized bear could sleep in the middle-sized
bed, and so we can go home the middle way, if we can’t
find the short or long way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fine!” exclaimed Tommy and Johnny together.</p>

<p>“How is that, grocery boy?” asked Mary, as she took a
tighter hold of his hand.</p>

<p>“It would be very nice, very nice, indeed,” said the
grocery boy, “but the truth of the matter is that I don’t
know even the middle way to your house. But, if you can
tell me what street it’s on, I think I could find it.”</p>

<p>“There we are again!” cried Tommy. “I wish we had
thought to have tags put on us, with our address, and then
we wouldn’t get lost, or, if we did, a postman could take
us home.”</p>

<p>Then the three little Trippertrots looked worried, and,
when the kind grocery boy saw this, he said:</p>

<p>“Never mind, I’m sure I can find your house sooner or
later. Come, we will walk along, and look for it. Whoever
sees it first will get a penny.”</p>

<p>“Who will give it to us?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“I will, myself, out of my own pocket,” said the grocery
boy. “See, I have a bright, new penny,” and he showed it
to the Trippertrots.</p>

<p>“Ah, but suppose <i>you</i> see the house first?” asked Mary.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">TOMMY, JOHNNY AND MARY BEGAN TO FLOAT UP INTO THE AIR</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I won’t, I promise you,” said the grocery boy. “I will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>walk along with my eyes shut, and you can lead me. Then
some of you will be sure to see the house first yourselves,
and you can have the penny, whoever is first.”</p>

<p>“But suppose we all see our house at the same time?”
inquired Johnny.</p>

<p>Once more the grocery boy took off his cap, and
scratched his nose and ear. Then he again waved his apron
like a flag, and said:</p>

<p>“Well, in that case, I will give you each a penny, as I
happen to have three,” and he showed them to the children.
So they walked along together, the grocery boy with
his eyes shut, so he couldn’t see the Trippertrot house first,
while Mary and Tommy and Johnny were eagerly watching
for it.</p>

<p>In this way the children went along for some distance,
but they couldn’t find their house. They saw many wonderful
things, however, such as men and ladies riding around
in automobiles, and some people in trolley cars, and they
saw a dog chasing a cat, and the cat ran up a tree, and her
tail was as big as two bananas. At last, however, Mary
said:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, I don’t believe we’ll ever find our home this
way. We ought to have the old fisherman, or Jiggily Jig,
or Simple Simon, or the newsboy, to help us. We’ll never
get home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we will,” said the grocery boy.</p>

<p>“Ah, I have an idea,” suddenly exclaimed Tommy.
“The grocery wagon horse knows where our house is, because
he stopped in front of it. Do you know where to
find your horse, grocery boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I expect he is in the stable now,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Then go get him, and he’ll take us home in the
wagon,” said Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“The very thing. I’ll do it at once!” exclaimed the
grocery boy. “You stay right here until I come back, and
I’ll soon have you home in your own house, and I think
the horse will know the shortest way, too.”</p>

<p>So the grocery boy started off to the stable, and the
Trippertrot children sat down on the front steps of a
house to wait for him to come back.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER EIGHT<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE BASKET OF CLOTHES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My, he</span> is gone a terrible long time,” said Mary Trippertrot,
after she and her brothers had waited, and waited,
and waited some more, for the grocery boy to come back.</p>

<p>“Yes, perhaps he is lost himself, looking for the stable
where his horse is,” suggested Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, grocery boys can’t get lost,” declared Tommy.
“They have to know their way everywhere, so as to deliver
groceries, and bread and butter and—and—lots of things.
They can’t get lost.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they can,” said Johnny. “Don’t you remember
when we once moved in a new house, and the grocery boy
came with some groceries? Suzette told him to put them
down cellar. He went down the stairs with his basket, and
pretty soon we heard him hollering like anything. He was
lost in the cellar, all right, so that shows you grocery boys
<i>can</i> get lost.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember <i>that</i> time,” said Mary, with a laugh.
“The boy hollered because Suzette forgot, and locked him
in the cellar, and he couldn’t get out.”</p>

<p>“Well, when you can’t get to where you want to go
you’re lost,” insisted Johnny, “so it’s the same thing. That
grocery boy was lost, and maybe this one is, who has gone
after the horse to take us home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not,” said Mary, “for it’s getting late, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
it will soon be dark. I wish we were home. But we’ll
wait here a little while longer.”</p>

<p>So the three little Trippertrots sat on the house-steps
and watched the people walking along the street.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Tommy, at length, “everybody
seems to have a house but us. See, they are all hurrying
home, and we have to stay here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s ask some of them to take us home, and not
wait for the grocery boy,” suggested Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, don’t do that,” begged Mary. “It will be
just as it always is. Folks will want to know where our
house is, so they can take us to it, and, of course, we can’t
tell them, and they’ll lead us off, and we’ll be lost more
than ever. The best way will be to wait right here, until
the grocery boy comes back with the horse, and then we’ll
get home, for some horses know more than people, when
it comes to taking lost children home to their papa and
mamma.”</p>

<p>“All right, then we’ll wait,” agreed Tommy and Johnny.</p>

<p>They sat on the steps for some little time longer, and,
pretty soon, along came a policeman swinging his club,
and the brass buttons on his coat sparkled just like diamonds
in the sunshine.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha, children!” he exclaimed. “What are you doing
here?”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell him we’re lost,” whispered Tommy to Mary.
So the little Trippertrot girl said:</p>

<p>“Oh, we are waiting here for the horse and wagon.”
She meant the grocery horse and wagon, you know.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said the policeman. “I hope it comes
soon. But don’t go away or you might be lost.” Then he
walked on, swinging his club, and Johnny laughed softly,
and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“He doesn’t know we are lost already! But we will
soon be at home.”</p>

<p>So they still sat there, and, by-and-by, a fireman came
along. He had been home to dinner, and now he was
going back to the engine house, to be ready to go to put
out any fires that might happen to burn things. The fireman
saw the children and he smiled at them.</p>

<p>“Ah, little ones,” he said, “I see you are sitting on the
stoop to get the fresh air. That is right, but don’t go
away, or you might get lost.”</p>

<p>Then the fireman hurried on to the engine house, and
Tommy laughed very softly and said:</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! He doesn’t know we are lost, either.”</p>

<p>And many other people passed by, and either spoke to
the Trippertrot children, or laughed at them, or smiled,
and still Tommy and Mary and Johnny sat on the steps
waiting, and waiting, and waiting, for the grocery boy to
come back with the horse and wagon.</p>

<p>And then, somehow or other, before she knew it, Mary
began to feel sleepy.</p>

<p>“I will just close my eyes for a minute or two,” she
said. “You boys can make-believe you are out camping in
the woods, and you can sit up on guard, while I sleep.”</p>

<p>Well, Tommy and Johnny thought that would be fun,
so they kept their eyes very wide open, but nothing happened,
and pretty soon they felt sleepy, but they wouldn’t
go to sleep, for they knew that soldiers never slumbered
while they were on guard.</p>

<p>Well, it was getting toward evening now, and it was
becoming somewhat cold, and still that grocery boy hadn’t
come. You see, he was lost himself, and he couldn’t find
the stable where the horse was, and he couldn’t find his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
way back to where the children were, and there they
waited, and waited, and waited.</p>

<p>And then something happened. All at once, along came
a boy with a big basket of clothes on a little wagon. Oh,
it was a very large basket, and a very small wagon, but it
was quite strong, and the boy was also quite strong, so he
could pull it very easily. But, when he came to the stoop
where the children were, he sat down on the curbstone to
rest. And the basket of clothes was so big that he didn’t
see the Trippertrot children because they were behind it.</p>

<p>But Tommy and Johnny, who hadn’t gone to sleep, but
who still sat beside their sister Mary, they saw the basket
of clothes. And they knew Mary was very tired, for her
head had fallen over on Tommy’s shoulder. Then Tommy
thought of something.</p>

<p>“I say, Johnny,” he exclaimed, “wouldn’t it be fine if
we could put Mary in the basket of clothes, so she could
have a nice rest?”</p>

<p>“Hum! It would be nice if we could get in ourselves,”
said Johnny, “only but the boy wouldn’t let us, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he wouldn’t,” agreed Tommy, and just then, as
truly as I’m telling you, the boy who had the basket of
clothes ran across the street to look in a toy shop window;
maybe he wanted to see if they had anything he could buy
for a penny. Anyhow, there was the basket of clothes on
the wagon, and there was no one near it except the Trippertrots.</p>

<p>“Now’s our chance!” exclaimed Tommy. “Quick! We’ll
put Mary in the basket, and get in ourselves.”</p>

<p>“But what about when the grocery boy comes back with
the horse for us?” asked Johnny.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71-72]</span>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_071">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_071.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“<i>Tuck Me in Good, I’m So Tired and Sleepy</i>”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I don’t believe he’s coming back,” spoke his brother,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“or else he’d be here now. We might as well get in the
clothes-basket and rest, and see what happens after that.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Johnny. So they lifted Mary up
very gently, for she was a little girl, and not very heavy,
and they were strong boys, if they were younger than their
sister, and they carried her over toward the basket of
clothes.</p>

<p>“Good-night, mamma,” murmured Mary, who was only
half awake. “Tuck me in good, I’m so tired and sleepy.”</p>

<p>“She thinks she’s home,” whispered Tommy.</p>

<p>“Yes, we mustn’t wake her up,” said Johnny, also in a
whisper. So, very gently, they lifted off the sheet that was
over the top of the clean, ironed clothes, and they laid
Mary down in among them. But first they put some newspapers
around her shoes so they wouldn’t dirty the towels
and pillow-cases, you know.</p>

<p>“Now let us get in ourselves,” said Johnny, and he and
his brother wrapped some newspapers around their shoes,
and then they crawled in the big basket of clothes beside
their sister Mary. Then they pulled the sheet up over
them, and then—and then—and then—they were both fast
asleep almost as quickly as the pussy cat can wiggle its
tail. Fast asleep in the basket of clothes were the Trippertrots.</p>

<p>Then the boy, who had been pulling the basket on his
wagon, came back from across the street. He didn’t buy
anything in the toy shop.</p>

<p>“Now I must take these clothes home,” he said to himself,
as he began to wheel them. And then, all of a sudden,
he exclaimed: “My! How heavy they are! I wonder what
makes that? I guess it must be because I’m going up hill.
Never mind, I’ll soon have them where they belong, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
then I’ll get the money and take it home to mamma, and
she’ll be happy.”</p>

<p>And, mind you, that boy never even dreamed that the
three Trippertrot children were in his basket of clothes.
He kept on wheeling them along the street, and once he
slipped on a banana-skin, and almost fell down. Almost, I
say, but not quite. And once a dog barked at him, not in
earnest, only in fun, you know. And, all the while, the
Trippertrots were fast asleep.</p>

<p>They even dreamed, too, as they were being wheeled
along in the basket. Mary dreamed she was in a balloon,
taking a trip through the air, and Tommy dreamed he
was on the tail of a kite, and Johnny dreamed that he was
bouncing up and down on a rocking-horse.</p>

<p>And, after a while, the boy who was pulling the basket
of clothes on his wagon came to a house. He stopped in
front of it. The house was painted green, and it had a red
roof, only you couldn’t see that part of it, unless you went
up in a balloon.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad I’m here with the clothes,” said the
boy. “Now I’ll take them in and get my money.”</p>

<p>So he carried the basket of clothes up into the house.
And there he found great excitement going on. The telephone
bell was ringing, and there was a policeman there,
and the nursemaid was running around through all the
rooms, and the lady and man were almost crying.</p>

<p>“My children! Oh, where are my children? They are
lost!” cried the lady. “Oh, have you seen my children?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m sorry to say I haven’t,” said the boy, and he
really hadn’t, you know. “But here are your clean clothes,
Mrs. Trippertrot,” he went on.</p>

<p>The lady took off the sheet from the basket of clothes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
and there she saw Mary and Tommy and Johnny, all fast
asleep.</p>

<p>“Oh, my darlings!” she exclaimed. “Here they are!
Oh, you dear washerwoman’s boy, to bring back my lost
children!” And she hugged him, and then Tommy and
Mary and Johnny awakened, and there they were, right in
their own home. It was their own mamma’s basket of
clothes into which they had crawled, never even guessing
it, and the boy, not knowing it, had brought them safely
home. The boy’s mamma was the washerwoman for Mrs.
Trippertrot, you see, and he always delivered the clean
clothes.</p>

<p>So there the Trippertrots were, but that wasn’t the last
of their adventures. No, indeed!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER NINE<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE POSTMAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> three little Trippertrots had not done any traveling
for some days now, and they were beginning to get a bit
tired of staying in the house so much. They were almost
wishing something would happen.</p>

<p>One day they were in the front parlor of their home,
looking out of the window, for it was Saturday, I think,
and they didn’t have to go to kindergarten school. Suddenly
the doorbell rang, and Mary said:</p>

<p>“Oh, I wonder who that is?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to look,” spoke Tommy.</p>

<p>“Mamma said we mustn’t do that,” said Mary. “It isn’t
polite.”</p>

<p>“It sounds like company ringing the bell,” spoke Johnny.
“And there goes Suzette to answer it,” he added, as the
nursemaid hurried down to the hall to the front door.</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember now!” exclaimed Mary. “I saw
mamma putting on her new silk dress a while ago, so she
must be going to have company. Come on, boys, we’d
better get out of the front room, for mamma doesn’t allow
us in there when she has visitors.”</p>

<p>“I know what we can do,” said Tommy, as he crawled
under a big chair to get his rubber ball, which had rolled
there.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Mary, eagerly.</p>

<p>“We can go upstairs to our playroom,” went on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
brother, “and then we can look down in the street, and see
whose carriage or automobile is there. Then we’ll know
what company mamma has, without looking out of the windows
down here.”</p>

<p>“That’s the very thing!” cried Johnny. “And maybe it’s
some of those ladies who play or sing in such high voices.
We can hear them upstairs, and it will be lots of fun.”</p>

<p>So the Trippertrot children started to go up to their
playroom, and in the hall they met Suzette.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” the nursemaid asked them, as
she paused on her way to answer the bell.</p>

<p>“Just upstairs to look out of the window,” replied Mary.</p>

<p>“Very well, but don’t go away,” cautioned Suzette.</p>

<p>“No, not unless it’s a very special, extra-extraordinary
occasion,” answered Johnny.</p>

<p>Once they were upstairs they all ran to the window and
looked down into the street below. There, in front of their
house, was a great big automobile, all enclosed with glass
windows, so the people in it wouldn’t get cold. And the
man who sat in front had on a big fur coat, like a shaggy
bear, so he wouldn’t get frosty.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know whose car that is!” cried Mary. “It belongs
to Mrs. Robertson Dudleyshire, and she doesn’t sing
or play, so we can’t hear her. It won’t be any fun at all.
I wish we had something to do.”</p>

<p>“Wait, maybe she will do something funny, so we can
hear it and laugh,” proposed Tommy, so they waited until
Mrs. Robertson Dudleyshire was sitting in the parlor below
them. They could hear her voice, a deep, rumbling one,
and they could hear their mother answering, but, as Mary
had said, there was “no fun,” and the Trippertrot children
didn’t know what to do.</p>

<p>“Hark! What’s that?” suddenly exclaimed Tommy, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
he heard a loud whistle out in the street. “Is that a policeman?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Maybe he’s chasing a dog, with a tin can tied to
his tail?” suggested Johnny.</p>

<p>“Why, you silly boys!” cried Mary. “That’s the postman’s
whistle. Perhaps he has some letters for us—maybe
invitations to some party. Let’s look out of the window.”</p>

<p>So they ran from the middle of the room, where they
had been sitting to listen to the rumble of Mrs. Robertson
Dudleyshire’s voice, to the front windows, and stuck their
little noses flat against the panes of glass, so they could
look down to the street.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! He isn’t coming to our house at all!” cried
Mary, as the letter-man passed by, with his bag over his
shoulder. “He’s gone next door.”</p>

<p>Once more the postman’s whistle sounded, and then
Tommy, who was watching him eagerly, hoping that perhaps
there might, after all, be a letter for the Trippertrot
home, uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“See!” Tommy exclaimed. “The postman has dropped
a letter from his bag, and he doesn’t know it. He’s going
right on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we must tell him about it!” decided Mary. “Knock
on the window, boys, and call to him. He’ll understand.”</p>

<p>So Tommy and Johnny knocked on the pane of glass
with their fingers, and Mary helped them, but they couldn’t
make noise enough so that the postman could hear them.
On he hurried, blowing his whistle, and he never thought
that he had lost a letter in the street.</p>

<p>“Raise the window and call to him!” said Mary.</p>

<p>So Tommy and Johnny tried to do this, but the window
was stuck fast, and they couldn’t open it. And all this time
the postman was getting farther and farther away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Well, we’ve got to do it!” sighed Mary, at last.</p>

<p>“Do what?” asked Tommy and Johnny together.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to run after the postman, and give him the
letter he lost,” said the little Trippertrot girl. “We’ve
tried every way we knew to make him hear us, but he
didn’t. Now we’ve got to go out. It’s a special, extra-extraordinary
occasion, anyhow, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Shall we tell mamma we’re going?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“No, she wouldn’t want to be bothered, when she has
company,” decided Mary. “Besides, we’ll be right back.
It’s only a step. Get your hats and coats, boys, for it’s quite
cold.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go down the back stairs,” suggested Tommy,
when they were all ready. “Then Suzette won’t see us, and
ask questions about where we’re going.”</p>

<p>So they did this, and soon they were running softly
along the narrow passageway at the side of the house, that
led from the back stoop. Out into the street they scampered
and they eagerly looked toward the place where they had
seen the letter fall.</p>

<p>Surely enough, it was still there, and Tommy, running
to it, eagerly picked up the envelope.</p>

<p>“It’s a real one, all right,” he said, “for it’s got a postage
stamp on it, and really-truly writing, with ink.”</p>

<p>“Does it say who it is to?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“It does, I guess,” answered her brother, “but I can’t
read writing.”</p>

<p>“If we could, it would save us the trouble of running
after the postman and giving it to him,” spoke Johnny.
“Where is he, anyhow?”</p>

<p>They looked up the street and down the street and all
over, but they couldn’t see the letter-man. I guess he had
gone around the corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“Oh, what shall we do?” asked Mary. “We can’t keep
the letter, and it wouldn’t be right to take it home. Oh, I
wish the postman hadn’t walked so fast!”</p>

<p>“I know what we can do!” cried Tommy. “We can be
the postman ourselves, and take the letter where it belongs.
We’ll ask the first person we meet where the right house
is, and we’ll go there. Then to-morrow we can tell the
postman, and he’ll be very glad the letter wasn’t lost.”</p>

<p>Johnny and Mary thought this a fine plan, so they
walked along, and pretty soon they met a man.</p>

<p>“If you please,” asked Tommy, “where does this letter
belong?” and he showed him the lost one.</p>

<p>“Ha! You are very little children to be out delivering
letters,” said the man. “Be careful you don’t get lost yourselves.”</p>

<p>“We won’t!” exclaimed the three little Trippertrots,
like two twins, and part of another one, you know. Then
the man said that if they went down to the corner, and
turned to their right for about four houses they would
come to the one where the letter belonged, for the man
had read the address.</p>

<p>Then he gave the children each a penny, for he loved
little ones, and Mary and Tommy and Johnny walked on
to deliver the letter for the postman.</p>

<p>Well, as true as I’m telling you, instead of turning to
the right when they got to the corner, they turned to the
left. Then, of course, when they went to the fourth house
the lady there said the letter didn’t belong to her. So they
tried the first house and the second and the third and the
fifth, up to over a dozen, on both sides of the street, but
they couldn’t find where that letter belonged.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Mary, when they had walked on
for some distance more. “I just knew this would happen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“What has happened?” asked Tommy. “We haven’t
lost the letter.”</p>

<p>“No, but we’re lost ourselves,” went on Mary. “Do you
boys know which way to go home?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Tommy, “I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Me either,” said Johnny. “We surely are lost again,
and we have the postman’s letter, and that’s lost, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we must be very careful of that letter,” said Mary.
“We must keep it safe. Here, Tommy, you had better let
me carry it. Boys are such careless creatures. I’ll put it
in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“Huh! We’ve got more pockets than you have,” declared
Johnny, but Mary took the letter and put it in her coat
pocket.</p>

<p>“Now we must decide what to do,” the little Trippertrot
girl said. “It will soon be night, and we ought to be
home, but we can’t find where we live. So let’s sit down
on this doorstep, and maybe a policeman will come along
and take us back to papa and mamma.”</p>

<p>So down they sat on the cold stone steps, and they
looked up and down the street for a kind policeman, but
they saw none. And they were—lost again—with a lost
letter. Oh, wasn’t it dreadful? But don’t worry. I’ll help
them all I can. You just wait for the next story and see
what happens.</p>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE MILKMAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh, dear</span>!” exclaimed Mary Trippertrot, after a while,
“if we didn’t want a policeman one would be sure to come
along, but when you do want one, there never is any. I
wonder what we had better do?”</p>

<p>“Well, I know what we <i>hadn’t</i> better do,” spoke
Tommy, her brother, quickly.</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Johnny, Mary’s other brother.</p>

<p>“We hadn’t better go any farther,” answered Tommy,
“or else we’ll be more lost than we are now.”</p>

<p>“We can’t be any <i>more</i> lost,” replied Mary, quickly.
“But I think we had better stay here until something
happens.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish it would happen very soon,” said Tommy.
“Oh, if only the old fisherman, or Jiggily Jig, the funny
boy, or even Simple Simon, or the pieman, would come
along now they might show us the way home.”</p>

<p>So they looked up and down the street, but they saw no
one, and then, all at once, they heard a jolly whistle.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s the postman!” cried Mary, jumping up.
“Now we can give him back the letter he dropped out of
his bag, and he will take us home.”</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t sound like the postman,” spoke
Tommy.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so either,” added Johnny.</p>

<p>“Then I wonder who it can be?” asked Mary, for there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
was no letter-man to be seen. “Who whistled? Is somebody
playing a trick?”</p>

<p>“I did!” cried a jolly voice, and, just as true as I’m
telling you, out from behind a telegraph pole danced Jiggily
Jig, the funny boy. “I whistled,” he said, and then
he turned two somersaults, one after the other, and laughed
in such a jolly way, that the Trippertrots didn’t in the least
mind being lost.</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“From behind the telegraph pole,” answered Jiggily Jig.</p>

<p>“And where have you been?” inquired Tommy.</p>

<p>“Behind the telegraph pole,” said Jiggily Jig. “Oh, I
was there ever so long, watching you children, but I wasn’t
sure you were the Trippertrots, so I didn’t want to come
out.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“I’m going back behind the telegraph pole, when I do
what I can for you,” replied Jiggily Jig. “I live there,
you know.”</p>

<p>“What, not behind a telegraph pole?” asked Mary.
“You don’t mean to tell me you live <i>there</i>!”</p>

<p>“Why not, I’d like to know?” asked Jiggily Jig. “People
live in houses, when telegraph poles are in <i>front</i> of them,
so why shouldn’t I live <i>behind</i> a telegraph pole? Come
here, and I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>So tripping, and leaping, and dancing, and jumping,
Jiggily Jig led the Trippertrots to the telegraph pole, and
there, as true as I’m telling you, was the cutest little house
you could imagine. It was made out of a whole lot of
little dolls’ houses built into one, and there was a front
porch, and steps with an upstairs to it, and a chimney on
the roof, and doors and windows, and everything that is
found in a regular house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“Oh, how lovely!” cried Mary, in delight.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s fine!” exclaimed Tommy and Johnny.</p>

<p>“Who made it?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“I did,” replied Jiggily Jig, proudly. “I would ask you
to come in, and have lunch with me,” the funny boy went
on, “but to tell you the truth, as I always do, the house is
only big enough for one to get in at a time. So we would
have to take turns going in to lunch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we shouldn’t mind that!” said Tommy, quickly,
for he was hungry.</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” added Johnny.</p>

<p>“And you could go in to lunch first,” went on Mary, for
she was also hungry.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s no use thinking about it,” said Jiggily Jig,
with a sigh, “for, to tell you the truth again, there is nothing
to eat for any of us, so there is no manner of use
going in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too bad!” exclaimed Tommy, and he was
more hungry than ever, and so were Mary and Johnny.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I’ll have something by supper time, if
you stay around long enough,” went on Jiggily Jig. “But
it seems to me that you are rather sad. Is there anything
I can do for you? Are you lost again?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mary, “we are. And this letter is lost,
too,” and she gave the funny boy the one the postman had
dropped.</p>

<p>“Oh, that letter is an easy matter,” said Jiggily Jig.
“First I will take it to where it belongs, and then I will
take you home.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know where we live!” objected Mary.
“You didn’t the last time, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85-86]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>So He Pulled on the Rope and Up Went the
House</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I think I know this time,” spoke Jiggily Jig. “Wait
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>until I look at the writing on the letter,” and he squinted
at it upside down.</p>

<p>“Why, you can’t read it that way, can you?” asked
Tommy. “I can read some letters in my picture book, but
I couldn’t if I turned them upside down.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s easy if you know how to do it,” spoke Jiggily
Jig. “To read a thing upside down, you have only to
stand on your head, like this,” and then, as quickly as a
cat can wash her face with her red tongue, the funny boy
gave a jump and there he was, standing on his head, and
reading the letter that way.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” he exclaimed. “Now I see where it belongs.
I will soon take it there, and soon take you home. Come
along, little Trippertrots,” and he started off up the street,
holding Mary by the hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, but aren’t you going to lock your house that stands
behind the telegraph pole?” asked Mary. “Some one might
get in while you are away.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t bother to lock it,” said Jiggily, “but I
have a better plan. Here, watch me.” Then he took hold
of a rope, that was fastened around the chimney of his
house, and the rope went up over the telegraph wires, and
came down on the other side. “I’ll just hoist my house in
the air,” said Jiggily Jig, “and then I’d like to see any one
get in.” So he pulled on the rope, and up went the house,
swinging and dangling in the air. Then Jiggily fastened
the rope around the telegraph pole, and left it there.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that’s a very good way,” said Tommy.
“Some one might come along, untie the rope, let your
house down to the ground, and go in it. Then you couldn’t
get in when you came back.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I never thought of that,” said Jiggily. “Wait, I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
fix that.” So he took a piece of paper and he wrote on it
a little message like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="bbox">
<p>PLEASE DON’T LET MY HOUSE DOWN, OR GO IN IT.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>“There, that will make it safe,” he said. “Now come
along, little ones, and we shall see what will happen next.”</p>

<p>So off down the street he led the Trippertrots, but it
was rather hard for them to keep up with Jiggily Jig, for
he was either dancing, or skipping, or turning somersaults
the whole livelong time, and sometimes he was out in the
street, and sometimes on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” thought Mary, “I hope we don’t meet any
one who knows us, or they’ll think we’ve gone out walking
with a circus clown, though, of course, Jiggily Jig is very
nice.”</p>

<p>But Mary didn’t meet any of her friends. In fact, there
seemed to be no one on the street, not even a policeman—only
the Trippertrot children and Jiggily Jig.</p>

<p>“Are we anywhere near the house where the letter belongs,
Jiggily?” asked Mary, after a while.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’ll look,” answered the funny boy, and
then he turned the letter upside down again, and stood on
his head to read the address on the envelope. “Yes, we
will be there pretty soon,” he said.</p>

<p>Then he and the Trippertrots went on some more, but
they couldn’t go very fast, for, every once in a while, Jiggily
would forget where the letter belonged, and he would
turn it upside down, and stand on his head to read it, and
all this took time.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you hold it right side up when you read it?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Then you won’t have to stand on your head,” suggested
Mary, who was getting tired and hungry.</p>

<p>“That would be a good way, I guess,” answered the
funny boy. “I’m glad you spoke of it, for I would never
have thought of it.”</p>

<p>After that they got along better, and pretty soon they
came to a fine, large house.</p>

<p>“I think this is where the letter belongs,” said Jiggily.
“I’ll go in and inquire, anyhow. The old fisherman lives
here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, can we go in and see him?” cried all the Trippertrots
together, for they liked the funny old man.</p>

<p>“No, I’m sorry, but you can’t,” answered Jiggily. “He
is busy fishing, up in the bathtub, and he doesn’t want to
be bothered. But if the letter doesn’t belong here, he can
tell me where to take it.”</p>

<p>“And can he tell you how to take us home?” asked
Tommy.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, surely. You wait here until I come back,”
and with that Jiggily went up the front steps and rang the
bell. But he didn’t wait for any one to come to the door,
for, seeing a window on the porch open, he just gave a
somersault and went in that way.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a queer way to go in a house!” exclaimed
Tommy, as he looked at the window through which Jiggily
Jig had vanished.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think it’s real jolly,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s very polite,” remarked Mary, “but
then I suppose Jiggily means it all right. It’s just one of
his funny ways. Oh, dear, I wish he’d hurry out. Let’s
sit down and wait. I wish we were home.”</p>

<p>Tommy and Johnny did, too, and they hadn’t been sitting
there very long, waiting for Jiggily, when, all at once,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
up drove a milk wagon, and out jumped the milkman, with
a whole lot of bottles of milk in a little wire basket.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re here, are you?” the milkman asked, of the
Trippertrots, with a jolly laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, did you expect to see us?” inquired Mary, for
she had never seen that milkman before, that she could
remember.</p>

<p>“Well, I generally expect to find you somewhere along
where I drive,” went on the milkman. “Your papa has
told me about you, and how you run away so much.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then, you know us!” exclaimed Tommy, in delight.</p>

<p>“To be sure I do,” was the milkman’s answer. “Why,
I leave milk at your house every morning. Of course I
know you, and sooner or later I’ve been expecting to find
you.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny, we never saw you at our house,” said
Johnny.</p>

<p>“No, but that’s because I come around so early in the
morning, so your papa can have cream in his coffee,” went
on the milkman. “But what are you doing here?”</p>

<p>Then the Trippertrots told him how they had run
out to give the lost letter to the postman, and how they had
become lost themselves, and how Jiggily Jig had started
home with them, and how they had reached the fisherman’s
house.</p>

<p>“But he’s in there now with the letter, and he’s been
gone some time, and we’re tired,” sighed Mary.</p>

<p>“I know just how you feel,” said the kind milkman.
“Well, I’ll soon fix it all right. I’ll go in to leave the
bottles of milk for the old fisherman. He pours it in the
bathtub, and fishes in it. Sometimes he catches eels, and
sometimes bits of cheese or butter. It doesn’t much matter
to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“But when I come out I’ll drive you home, and you
won’t have to worry any more. Now you go hop in my
wagon, and I’ll be out very shortly.”</p>

<p>“And will you tell Jiggily Jig that we’re much obliged
to him, and that you’ll take us home?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“To be sure I will,” answered the milkman, and then
he went around the side of the house to leave the bottles
of milk, while Mary and Johnny and Tommy ran and got
in the milk wagon, cuddling down in the straw that was on
the floor.</p>

<p>And, oh! how nice and warm and comfortable it was
there.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon be home now,” said Mary, drowsily, for she
was very tired.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tommy and Johnny together, and they, too,
were very sleepy, and, before you could count fifty backwards,
the three Trippertrot children were slumbering in
the milk wagon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER ELEVEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE LITTLE BABY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> of a sudden Mary woke up. She looked out of the
little door in the wagon, and she saw houses and trees and
telegraph poles moving quickly by.</p>

<p>“My goodness!” exclaimed the little Trippertrot girl,
“I wonder why everything is going so fast?”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” politely asked Tommy, as he awakened,
when he heard his sister speaking. “What’s the matter,
Mary?”</p>

<p>“Are we home yet?” asked Johnny, in his sleepy voice,
and he cuddled down farther into the warm straw.</p>

<p>“No, we’re not home, as far as I can see,” answered
Mary, looking out of the wagon again, “but everything is
sailing past me so very fast—trees, and houses and people
and telegraph poles and——”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s us that are sailing!” cried Tommy, when he
had taken a peep. “It’s just like riding in a railroad train,
when you look out of the window, and you see everything
flying past—horses and cows and sheep and farms and
fences and trees and telegraph poles and everything. We
are moving, Mary, and not the things on the street.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” said Johnny, when he had peered out.</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness!” cried Mary. “Then the milkman’s
horse must be running away with us, and the milkman isn’t
here! Just take a look, Tommy dear, and see if it isn’t so.”</p>

<p>So Tommy looked, and then he cried out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“Say, I should think he <i>was</i> running away! He’s going
so fast that you can’t notice his legs move.”</p>

<p>“Really?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“Look for yourselves and see,” invited Tommy, so Mary
and Johnny looked, and, surely enough, the horse was running
as fast as he could along the street, pulling the milk
wagon after him, and the three Trippertrot children were
inside, down in the warm straw.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Mary. “How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Tommy. “Perhaps a little
dog barked at the horse, and he ran away.”</p>

<p>“Who ran, the horse or the dog?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“The horse, of course,” replied Tommy, “and he’s running
away now.”</p>

<p>“And with us, too; he’s running away with us!” said
Mary. “I wonder where he’ll take us?”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’ll take us home,” spoke Tommy. “You know
the milkman said he left milk at our house every morning,
before we were out of bed, and maybe the horse knows
where our house is. We’ll just stay in the wagon, and
see what happens.”</p>

<p>“Well, if the horse doesn’t bring us to our house, he
may go to his own stable,” said Johnny. “Then the milkman
will come after him, and he’ll find us, and he’ll take
us home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be nice,” said Mary. So the three Trippertrot
children stayed in the wagon, and the horse kept
going on faster and faster, but still it was very nice, for
the street was smooth, and they didn’t get shaken up the
least bit.</p>

<p>And it was comfortable and warm and cozy down in
the straw, and there were lots of bottles. After a bit the
children were hungry, so they drank some of the milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“We’ll ask mamma or papa to pay the man for it,” said
Tommy. “They will, for they like us to drink it.”</p>

<p>All this time the horse was pulling the milk wagon
farther and farther away. The children kept peering out,
but they couldn’t see any house that looked like theirs, and
they thought they must have come a long distance from
home.</p>

<p>All of a sudden the Trippertrots heard some one out in
the street crying:</p>

<p>“Whoa! Whoa there, horsie!”</p>

<p>Then the milkman’s horse stopped running, and the
wagon, of course, stopped also.</p>

<p>“Ha! I wonder who that can be?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“I’m going to look and see,” spoke Johnny, so out he
peeped and then he cried: “Why, it’s Simple Simon, and
the pieman is with him.”</p>

<p>“Really?” asked Mary. “I wonder what they want?”</p>

<p>“We want some milk, if you please,” answered the pieman,
putting his head in through the milkman’s wagon
window—not through the glass, you understand, or he
would have been cut, but through the open window. “I
would like some milk,” went on the nice pieman.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Mary, who always liked to know
the reason for everything.</p>

<p>“I have to use it to make pies,” said the pieman. “I
am going to make a custard pie for Simple Simon, and I
need milk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I have found my penny, though at first I
thought I hadn’t any,” said Simple Simon, “so I am going
to buy a pie for little Jack Horner, who sits in the corner.
But it isn’t going to be a Christmas pie, and there aren’t
going to be any plums in it—only custard. And you have
to have milk for a custard pie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“Then you can take all you want, but you will have to
pay the milkman, because we have no money,” said Mary,
and the pieman said he would, as the milkman was a
friend of his.</p>

<p>Then the Trippertrots each handed out a bottle of milk
to the pieman, and away the milkman’s horse galloped
again, pulling the wagon after him.</p>

<p>“I wonder what will happen next?” asked Mary, and
hardly had she spoken, than the horse stopped in front of
a house that had a red chimney on top, and green shutters
on the windows.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe this is our house!” cried Tommy.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” said Mary, quickly, as she looked out of
the wagon. “We don’t live here at all. But since the
horse stopped here, maybe he means for us to get out.
Perhaps we shall have another adventure here.”</p>

<p>“I’m a little tired of having adventures,” said Tommy.
“I want to go home.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” added his brother.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll just see what is here,” suggested Mary, so
they got out of the milk wagon, and started to go up to
the house, in front of which the horse had stopped. As
soon as they were out of the wagon, the horse laid down
in the street, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said Mary, when she saw this. “He
won’t run away and leave us, as the grocery wagon horse
did.”</p>

<p>As the Trippertrot children were going up the steps of
the house, to see who lived there, they heard a baby crying.
Oh, how sadly that baby cried! and Mary and Tommy and
Johnny knew the big tears must be running down its face,
for they were once babies themselves, and they knew what
happens when you cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Poor little baby!” exclaimed Mary. “I wonder what’s
the matter with it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe a pin is sticking it,” suggested Tommy.</p>

<p>“Maybe it can’t find its rattlebox,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>And just then the door of the house opened, and out
came a nice lady.</p>

<p>“I heard what you children said,” she exclaimed, “and
the trouble with my baby is that he is hungry.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you give him something to eat, then?” asked
Johnny.</p>

<p>“I do,” answered the lady. “I sent the nurse girl to the
store for some milk, but she has been gone an hour, and is
not back yet, and my baby is crying with hunger. I can’t
see what keeps that girl.”</p>

<p>“Maybe she is lost, the same as we are,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor little dears! Are you lost?” asked the
nice lady. “Then come right in the house and get warm.”</p>

<p>“And may we see the baby?” asked Mary, who loved
little children.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said the lady, so she took them into the
parlor, where the baby was lying in a cradle. Oh! it was
the loveliest baby you can imagine! It had such cute little
hands and feet, and such blue eyes, and it was all rosy and
dimples, and it smelled just like talcum powder perfume.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t it a dear!” exclaimed Mary.</p>

<p>“Wah! Wah! Wah!” cried the baby, all of a sudden, as
it took hold of Mary’s little finger.</p>

<p>“Poor little dear, he’s hungry, and I can’t see what
keeps that nurse girl who went for the milk,” said the lady.
“Oh, where can I get something to eat for my baby?”</p>

<p>“Why, we have a whole wagonful of milk!” cried
Tommy.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“AND SUCH BEAUTIFUL PRESENTS,” MURMURED JOHNNY</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Of course,” said Johnny. “It belongs to the milkman,
but his horse ran away with us.”</p>

<p>“And you can have all the milk you want for your
baby,” went on Mary. “Tommy, you and Johnny go and
bring in some bottles, please.”</p>

<p>So the Trippertrot boys did this, and soon the lady had
warmed some milk for the baby, and then it wiggled its
pink toes, and held tight hold of Mary’s little finger, and
drank the milk out of a bottle just as any baby should.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s too sweet and cute for anything!” cried the
little Trippertrot girl. “I wish he was mine.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t give up my baby,” said the nice lady,
“but some day you may come, and take him out in his
carriage. But I am sorry to hear that you are lost. Don’t
you know where your home is?”</p>

<p>“No, we never do,” answered Tommy. “We’re the Trippertrots,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ve heard of you,” said the lady. “Well, perhaps
I can think of some way to send you home.”</p>

<p>And all of a sudden there was a noise out in the street,
and Mary, looking from the window, cried:</p>

<p>“There goes the milkman’s horse! He’s running away.”</p>

<p>And the next moment there was a knock on the door,
and in came the old fisherman who used to catch fish in
the bathtub.</p>

<p>“Oh, how glad I am that I have found you,” said the
old fisherman to the children. “I have been looking all
over for you. Now I will take you home.” And then what
do you think? He took his fishpole and began fishing in
the baby’s carriage!</p>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE BABY CARRIAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the baby’s mamma saw the queer old fisherman
fishing in the baby’s carriage she cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, you funny man! Why are you doing that?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” exclaimed Mary Trippertrot, in a whisper,
“don’t disturb him, please. He always fishes in strange
places, and you should see the queer things he catches.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” went on Tommy, “once he fished up an umbrella
and a pair of rubber boots from a little lake.”</p>

<p>“And a raincoat, and right after that it began to rain,
and we put the things on—that is, the boots and raincoat—and
held the umbrella over us, and we didn’t get wet, and
we went to the house of the false-face man,” said Johnny,
almost out of breath.</p>

<p>“My! My! What queer children you are, and what odd
adventures you must have had,” said the baby’s mamma,
while the baby lay in the crib and drank the milk from
the bottle.</p>

<p>“Oh, we are the Trippertrots, and we are always getting
lost, and having funny things happen to us,” said
Mary. “This time we got lost because we ran out after
the postman, to give him back a letter he had dropped, and
Jiggly Jig found us, and then he went in a house, and
the milkman told us to get in his wagon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the milkman’s horse ran away with us, and
here we are,” finished Tommy, for by this time Mary was
out of breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“And I wonder where the fisherman will take us?”
spoke Johnny.</p>

<p>“He said he’d take us home,” replied Tommy. “Ah,
he’s caught something!” he cried, for at that moment the
funny old fisherman, who had not spoken since he began
fishing, pulled up his hammock-hook and line, and there,
dangling on the end of it, was a baby’s pink knitted sock.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha!” exclaimed the old fisherman. “I rather
thought I would catch something this time. This is better
than a fish,” and making a low bow he handed the baby’s
sock to the baby’s mamma.</p>

<p>“Oh, where did you get it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I fished it up out of the baby’s carriage,” said the old
fisherman, with a jolly laugh. “Perhaps I can catch something
else if I try.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” said the lady. “I have been looking
all over for my baby’s pink socks, and I couldn’t find
them. I never thought to look in the carriage.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can fish up the other one,” said the old
fisherman, and then he sat down on the piano stool, and
began dangling his hook and line in the baby carriage
again, while the baby drank milk from the bottle, and the
Trippertrot children and the lady looked at the fisherman.
I forgot to tell you that on the end of the fisherman’s line
was a hammock-hook. It wasn’t very sharp, and it couldn’t
hurt any one, not even a baby’s pink sock, you see.</p>

<p>“There, I think I have something!” cried the fisherman
at last, as he pulled up his line again. “The other sock!”
he exclaimed, and there, surely enough, dangling from the
hammock-hook, was the second pink sock.</p>

<p>“Oh, how very kind of you!” cried the lady. “I wish
you would always stay here, and fish for the things that are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
lost. The baby loses so many things, and then there’s the
little dog—he hides things.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we have a dog!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“His name is Fido!” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“And we have a cat named Ivy Vine,” added Johnny.</p>

<p>“How very nice,” said the lady, while the baby lay in
the crib, looked up at the ceiling and blinked his blue eyes.
“I will show you our dog,” went on the lady. “His name
is Bony.”</p>

<p>“What a funny name!” exclaimed Mary. “Why do you
call him that?”</p>

<p>“Because he is so fond of bones,” the lady said. Then
she called: “Here, Bony! Bony! Bony!” and in came running
a little, fat poodle dog, and he stood up on his hind
legs, and wagged his tail, and then he tried to get hold of
Tommy’s shoe, to pull it off.</p>

<p>“Why does he do that?” the little Trippertrot boy
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I guess he thinks it’s something he can hide,” answered
the lady. “Bony is the greatest dog for hiding
things! He carries off my slippers, and my husband’s
shoes, and all the baby’s rattleboxes, and hides them in
such funny places. Sometimes in the icebox, and sometimes
under the parlor chairs, and sometimes even down
cellar in the coal-bin.</p>

<p>“That’s why I wish you could stay here and fish for
the things that are lost,” the lady said to the nice old
fisherman.</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” he answered, with a low bow,
“but I can’t stay. I came after the Trippertrot children,
to take them home. They’re lost, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, so we are, I nearly forgot,” spoke Mary.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you can find our house?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“I certainly can,” replied the fisherman, with another
jolly laugh.</p>

<p>“But how are we going to get home?” asked Mary.
“The milk wagon horse has run away, and we can’t walk,
because it is so far. What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed the fisherman, scratching his nose
with the hammock-hook that wasn’t sharp. “I could carry
you on my back, one at a time, I suppose. That is, I could
carry Mary home first, and then come back for Johnny or
Tommy, and if I took Tommy next I could carry Johnny
last.”</p>

<p>“But we would be pretty late getting home, wouldn’t
we?” asked Johnny. “At least, I would be if you took me
last.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Mary. “Can’t you think of some
other way, Mr. Fisherman?”</p>

<p>“Hum!” he said. “If I only had an automobile now, or
an airship, we would be all right.”</p>

<p>“Or if we each had a toy green or red balloon, we
could take hold of them, and float home,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t anything like that,” spoke Mary. “Oh,
dear, it’s dreadful to be lost! I wonder what we can do,
and how you can take us all home at once?”</p>

<p>“I have it!” suddenly cried the baby’s mamma. “Down
in our cellar is a great big baby carriage, that I had once
when there were twins here, but they are now big children,
and don’t need the carriage. I’m sure it would hold you
three children very easily, and then the fisherman could
wheel you home in it.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” exclaimed the fisherman. “The very thing!
I will soon have the Trippertrots home now, and I hope
they never wander away again.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, we never will!” they all promised at once.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
But you just wait for some more stories about them, and
see what happens. However, now I must tell you about
the baby carriage.</p>

<p>“Where did you say the carriage was?” asked the fisherman.</p>

<p>“Down cellar,” answered the lady. “I will get it for
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, don’t trouble yourself,” said the fisherman. “I
will fish it up,” and, surely enough, he stood at the head
of the cellar steps, dangled his line down, and soon he had
hooked on to the carriage, and lifted it up. It was a very
big one, and would easily hold the three little Trippertrots.</p>

<p>So they got into it, and the lady wrapped a warm
blanket over them, and they said good-by to her and to the
cute, cunning little baby, and off the old fisherman started
with them, wheeling the carriage down the front steps as
easily as a kittie cat can lap up her milk.</p>

<p>“Come and see me some time, when you aren’t lost,”
called the lady after them, as she waved her hand out of
the window.</p>

<p>“We will,” promised Mary and Tommy and Johnny
Trippertrot.</p>

<p>Away they went, along the street, the old fisherman
wheeling them toward their home. The Trippertrots were
tired and sleepy and hungry, for they had been away for
some time now.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, as the fisherman was wheeling them, a
lady on the street came up and stopped them.</p>

<p>“Oh, may I see the pretty babies in the carriage?” she
asked. “I just love babies!”</p>

<p>“These aren’t babies,” said the fisherman, “they are the
lost Trippertrot children, and I am taking them home. But
you may look at them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>So the lady looked, and she leaned over to kiss Mary,
and the fur thing the lady wore around her neck tickled
Tommy so that he sneezed three times.</p>

<p>“How cute!” exclaimed the lady, as she walked away.</p>

<p>Then they went on a little farther, and pretty soon another
lady cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, may I see the pretty babies in the carriage?”</p>

<p>“They aren’t babies—they are the lost Trippertrot children,”
said the old fisherman. “But you may see them.”</p>

<p>So this lady looked, and she kissed Mary, and the fur
thing she wore on her neck tickled Johnny so that he
awakened from his sleep.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said the lady.</p>

<p>Then they went on some more, and a third lady said:</p>

<p>“Oh, may I just have one look at the pretty babies in
the carriage?” for she couldn’t see that they weren’t babies,
because they were covered up with the blanket, you know.</p>

<p>“These are the lost Trippertrot children,” said the old
fisherman. “They were lost, and I am taking them home,
but if you will excuse me saying so, I’ll never get there if
all the ladies want to look at them.”</p>

<p>Then the third lady leaned over to kiss Tommy, and
the feathers in her hat tickled Mary so that she sneezed
three times, and part of another one.</p>

<p>“Goodness me!” exclaimed the lady.</p>

<p>“Now I am going to run home with you,” said the old
fisherman, and soon he was safe at the Trippertrot house,
and my! how glad Mary and Tommy and Johnny were to
get back. Their papa and mamma hugged and kissed them,
and so did Suzette, the nursemaid, and the children said
they would never go away from home again.</p>

<p>But, oh, dear! Just read the next story and see what
happened.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER THIRTEEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE OLD MAN’S HAT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> very windy day the three little Trippertrots were
up in the playroom of their house, looking out of the
window and wondering what they could do to have a good
time.</p>

<p>“Now I do hope you children will not run off anywhere
to-day,” their mamma had said to them as she went
downtown to the five-and-ten-cent store to buy a new fur
coat—excuse me, I meant a dipper. “Please stay in the house
unless something special, extra-extraordinary happens.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we will,” promised Mary; and Tommy and
Johnny, her brothers, promised the same thing.</p>

<p>Well, as they were looking out of the window of the
playroom, they saw a nice old gentleman crossing the street
in front of their house. The old man was going very
slowly, because he had rheumatism, I guess, or maybe the
epizootic, when all at once, the wind, which was blowing
very hard, blew right up under his tall silk hat, and blew
it off his head. It almost blew off the hair on the old gentleman’s
head, and if it had not been fastened tightly there,
something like that surely would have happened.</p>

<p>“Oh, there goes his hat!” cried Tommy.</p>

<p>“And see how it rolls along the street!” exclaimed
Johnny. “It’s almost as good as a football,” and he laughed
out loud.</p>

<p>“Oh, you shouldn’t laugh when any one is in trouble,”
spoke Mary, kindly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“He can’t hear me,” answered Johnny. “Besides, I am
really sorry for him.”</p>

<p>“If you are sorry I should think you would go out and
help him catch his hat,” spoke Tommy. And truly, the
hat of the old man was now rolling swiftly along the street,
where the wind blew it, and the old gentleman was chasing
after it—after his hat, I mean, not after the wind. Oh, my
goodness me, no, and a basket of onions besides!</p>

<p>“We are not to leave the house—mamma said so,” spoke
Mary, firmly.</p>

<p>“But I think this is a special, extra-extraordinary occasion,”
declared Tommy. “Mamma would want us to go
out and help catch the hat for the old man if she were
here. I’m sure she would, for she always likes us to be
kind to old people, and that gentleman can’t catch his hat
all by himself. He can’t run fast enough.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Johnny. “See him run! Oh, see
him run!”</p>

<p>And, surely enough, the old gentleman was running
after his hat as fast as anything. But, no matter how fast
he ran, the wind blew his hat still faster, and it rolled
along just in front of him. Every once in a while the old
man would think he had the hat, and then the wind would
come in a sudden puff, and presto-chango! away the hat
would roll again, down the street.</p>

<p>“Oh, we ought to help him!” exclaimed Mary Trippertrot.
“There is no one else out in the street to do it.”</p>

<p>“Then I will!” cried Tommy. “I’m going to get his hat
for him.”</p>

<p>“And so am I,” added Johnny. “Come on, Mary.”</p>

<p>Then they got ready to run out of doors to help the old
man get back his hat.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, we really oughtn’t to go,” spoke Mary, “for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
we will be sure to be lost, as we always are. But I can’t
let you boys go alone. I must be with you. I suppose this
is one of those special, extra-extraordinary occasions, and
mamma won’t mind very much.”</p>

<p>So Mary Trippertrot and her brothers, Tommy and
Johnny, slipped softly down the front stairs, so Suzette,
the nursemaid, wouldn’t see them, and out of doors they
went.</p>

<p>“Hurry up!” called Tommy, as he ran on ahead, “the
old man is nearly around the corner chasing his hat. We
must help him, or his hat will be spoiled.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” said Mary, and away they raced, forgetting
everything that their mamma had told them about
not going out of the house. But they wanted to do a kindness,
you see.</p>

<p>Pretty soon they turned around the corner, and there,
down the street, they saw the old man still chasing after
his hat. The Trippertrot children soon caught up to him.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want, little ones?” the man asked,
as he turned around and saw them.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir,” said Mary, “we have come to help
you chase your hat.”</p>

<p>“Ha! That is very kind of you,” spoke the old man, in
a most polite voice. “I am sure I will get my hat now,
with so many of us after it. If only the wind didn’t blow
so hard my hat would stop rolling along the ground, and
then I could get it alone. But I am glad you have joined
me. Come on, now, we’ll see if we can’t race after that
hat.”</p>

<p>So on ran the Trippertrots, and on ran the nice old
man, after his hat, which the wind was making go faster
and faster, just like when you roll a hoop.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m afraid my hat will be ruined!” cried the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
man, as he saw it roll into a puddle of water, and bounce
out again. “And it is a nice new hat, and inside the lining
is a dollar bill that I was saving to buy a Christmas present
for my little grandson.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then we must surely get that hat!” said Mary,
and she ran on faster than ever, and Tommy and Johnny
Trippertrot also ran faster, and the old man ran as fast as
he could.</p>

<p>“Look out!” suddenly cried Mary. “That automobile
is going to run over your hat, and if it does it will squash
it flatter than a sheet of paper.”</p>

<p>“So it will!” agreed the old man, as he looked up in
time to see a big automobile rushing along the street, and
his hat was almost under the fat wheels of the car.</p>

<p>“Hi, there, Mr. Auto Man! Stop your machine, if you
please!” cried the old man. “Don’t run over my hat!”</p>

<p>And the auto man stopped his car just in time—that is,
almost in time—for he just ran over a little part of the rim
of the hat, and broke off a small piece.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too bad!” exclaimed Mary, as she made a
grab for the tall silk hat, but she was just too late.</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind,” spoke the old man, as the hat went
rolling on down another street, just as Tom-Tom the piper’s
son ran roaring down the street after he took the pig, you
know. “I can mend the broken place with court-plaster,
if only I can get my hat.”</p>

<p>“We’ll help you,” said Tommy, and then the Trippertrot
children ran on faster than ever after the old man’s
hat.</p>

<p>But the hat was blown very hard by the wind, which
didn’t seem to want to let go of it. Once the hat was
nearly blown under a big, heavy wagon, and the wheels
almost rolled over it. Then, a little later, some horses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
almost stepped on it, and one horse thought it was something
good to eat, and was going to chew it, only his
driver wouldn’t let him.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, along came a trolley car, and
this nearly ran over the hat, only the motorman stopped his
car in time. He even got off, and tried to grab the hat,
but the wind blew it on farther still, for the breeze was
very strong.</p>

<p>“Oh, hadn’t we better go back home?” asked Mary,
when they had been chasing the hat for some time. “We
might get lost.”</p>

<p>“We’re lost now,” spoke Johnny, as he looked around,
though he didn’t stop running. “We’ve never been in this
part of the city before.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we’re lost we can’t get any more lost than we
are,” said Mary. “We might as well keep on, and try to
get the hat for the old gentleman. I like him, as he looks
so much like the kind fisherman.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Tommy and Johnny, for they also
liked the old gentleman. So on they ran, after the old man
who was chasing his hat.</p>

<p>Once the hat blew into the canal, and got all wet, and
the next minute it blew out and went almost under the
wheels of a choo-choo locomotive, but it rolled away just
in time.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, the wind gave a big puff, as
if it was blowing out a candle, and presto-chango! the hat
blew up into a tree, and there it stuck.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s fast, anyhow,” said the old man, who had
almost no breath left, after running so far.</p>

<p>“Yes, it can’t go any more, unless the tree blows with
it,” spoke Johnny.</p>

<p>“But how are you going to get it down?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Oh, I know,” said Mary. “One of you boys must climb
up the tree, or we can borrow a step-ladder from the house
next door, and use that.”</p>

<p>“Let me climb!” cried Johnny.</p>

<p>“No, let me,” said his brother.</p>

<p>“You may both climb up,” declared the old gentleman,
with a laugh. “I want my hat as quickly as I can get it, for
I am catching cold.”</p>

<p>So up into the tree scrambled Johnny and Tommy, and
soon they had the old man’s hat safe. It was a little bit
battered and torn, by bouncing along so much, but that
didn’t hurt it much. Then the old man put it on his head.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Mary began to cry.</p>

<p>“Why, what is the matter?” asked the nice old man.
“Are you hungry?”</p>

<p>“No, I am not hungry,” answered Mary, “but we are—lost!”</p>

<p>“And we don’t know our way home!” added Tommy,
and he cried, too, but only a little.</p>

<p>“And we’re always getting lost,” went on Johnny, as he
started to cry a tear or two. “We’re always getting lost,
and this time it was because we chased after your hat.”</p>

<p>“That is too bad,” said the old man. “And, as you have
been so kind to me I will be kind to you. Come along, I
will take you back home. I know where it is, because my
hat blew off right in front of there. Come along, Trippertrots.”</p>

<p>So he brushed the dust off his hat, and put it on his
head—put on his hat, I mean, not the dust—and then he
took hold of Mary’s hand and Johnny’s, and Johnny took
hold of Tommy’s hand, and away they started for the Trippertrot
home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER FOURTEEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE CHRISTMAS TREE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a while they walked on silently.</p>

<p>“Do you think you can find our house for us?” asked
Mary, of the kind old man, as she took a closer hold of his
hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am sure I can,” he said. “It was right in front
of your house that the wind blew off my hat, so I won’t
easily forget it.”</p>

<p>“Lots of people think they can take us home after we
are lost,” said Johnny, “but, somehow or other, they don’t
do it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Tommy Trippertrot. “There was Jiggily
Jig, the funny boy, who is always dancing, or turning
somersaults, and there was the nice, little old lady, and the
man who had the pink cow, and the other man who had
the dancing bears, and the milkman, and the grocery boy,
and the fireman, and the old fisherman——”</p>

<p>“My, my!” exclaimed the old man whose hat had been
blown off by the wind. “Do you know as many people as
all that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and more,” spoke Mary. “You see, we are
always getting lost, and every one is kind to us, so they start
to take us home. But, just as Johnny says, we never seem
to get there, except, of course, once in a while.”</p>

<p>“Or, if we do get home, we run out after something or
other, and we’re lost again,” said Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“Well, don’t worry, I’ll take you safely home,” said the
man, as he put his hat on his head real tightly, so the wind
couldn’t blow it off again.</p>

<p>And then he and the children walked along some more,
and, all at once, they came to a toy store. And, oh, what
lovely things there were in the windows; toy boats, and toy
houses, and dolls, and doll carriages, and toy automobiles,
and steam engines that really went “choo-choo!” And there
were whirligigs, and clowns that you couldn’t make lie
down straight, no matter how you tried, for they always
bobbed up again, smiling at you just like the Cheshire cat
in the story.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a lovely place!” cried Mary. “Let’s stop
here a while, and choose things.”</p>

<p>“Choose things; what do you mean?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Johnny, “when we haven’t any money we
look in the toy shop windows, and we choose the things
we’d like to have and make-believe they’re ours. But we
always let Mary have first choice, because she’s a girl, you
know.”</p>

<p>“That is very nice and polite of you,” said the man.
“Boys should always be kind to their sisters, and all other
ladies. But since you have no money, and as you have been
very kind to help me get my hat, I will take you in the
toy shop and buy you each a toy, and you may choose
whatever you like, only this will be real, and not make-believe,
for you may take the toys home with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, really?” inquired Mary, in delight.</p>

<p>“Do you mean truly?” asked Tommy, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“And really-truly and truly-really?” asked Johnny, for
it was such a strange thing that he wanted to be quite sure
about it.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, this is in earnest,” said the kind man, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
smile. “So come in and pick out what toys you like best.
It is near Christmas time, and you can count this as one of
your Christmas presents.”</p>

<p>“And may Mary have first choice?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“Surely,” said the man, and he was glad that Tommy
and Johnny were so kind to their little sister, but then they
were most always that way, and I hope you are, too; but
of course you are, so I needn’t have said that last part,
need I?</p>

<p>And if the window of the toy shop was lovely, the inside
of the shop was more beautiful still. Oh! so many
toys as there were! It was just like the place where Santa
Claus makes all the nice things for the girls and boys. In
fact, some of the toys had just come from the workshop of
dear old St. Nicholas himself.</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to choose, Mary?” asked
Tommy, of his sister, when they had looked around a bit.</p>

<p>“I—I think I’ll have that nice big doll over there,”
said the little girl, after a while, when she had examined
many things.</p>

<p>So the toy shop clerk gave Mary the big doll, and the
man, whose hat the Trippertrot children had run after,
smiled and said:</p>

<p>“Now, Tommy, it’s your turn.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take that nice sailboat,” said Tommy Trippertrot,
and the toy shop clerk gave it to him.</p>

<p>“And now what will Johnny have?” asked the kind
man.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll take that music-box, that plays such pretty
tunes,” said the other boy, for the toy shop clerk had
wound the box up while the children were looking around,
and it played “Yankee Doodle,” and “Home, Sweet Home,”
and a funny tune called “Don’t Laugh When You Sneeze,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
and Don’t Give the Cat Cheese.” Oh! that last is a very
fine tune, indeed.</p>

<p>So the toy shop clerk gave Johnny the music-box, and
then each of the Trippertrot children had a nice toy, and
the man, whose hat the wind had blown off, paid for them,
and he and the children went out in the street again.</p>

<p>“Now I will surely take you home,” said the kind man.
“We will go down this street, and up another, and across a
third, and along a fourth, and then we will be there.”</p>

<p>So along they went, the children looking at their toys,
and feeling very happy that Christmas was so near at hand,
when, all at once, they heard some one singing around the
corner. Then they heard a whistle, and a voice cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, there are the Trippertrot children! How glad I
am to see them. Let me take them home, if you please,
Mr. Man, for I am sure they are lost,” and there stood
Jiggily Jig, the funny boy, who was always dancing.</p>

<p>“Yes, we are lost again,” said Mary Trippertrot, “but
this gentleman will take us home, for I am afraid you
don’t know the way.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps I might get lost, too,” admitted Jiggily.
“But, what lovely toys you have! May I see them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are Christmas presents,” said Tommy, and
then Mary showed her new doll, and Tommy showed his
ship, and Johnny showed his music-box, and played a nice
little dancing tune on it.</p>

<p>And, no sooner did the music start than Jiggily Jig
began dancing, and away down the street he danced, turning
over and over in somersaults, until he was out of sight.</p>

<p>“There, you see!” exclaimed Mary, “it’s a good thing
we didn’t let him take us home, or we’d never get there.”</p>

<p>“I think so myself,” said the man. Then he led them
on a little farther, and, pretty soon, they met the pieman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
and Simple Simon was with him, coming from the fair,
and the pieman and Simple Simon wanted to take the
Trippertrot children home, but they said the hat man had
better do it.</p>

<p>And then they met the old fisherman, and the nice old
lady, and the pink-cow man, and the dancing-bear man,
and each and every one wanted to take the Trippertrot
children home, but Mary and her brother said they had
rather go with the man whose hat the wind had blown off.
So they did, and pretty soon, what do you think?</p>

<p>In a little while the man came to a long, wide street,
and he looked at his watch, and said:</p>

<p>“Now I needn’t go any farther, for there is your house
right down there. Besides, I haven’t time. I have to catch
a train.”</p>

<p>“Do you catch a train just like you catch a ball?” asked
Tommy, who wanted to know about lots of things.</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” said the man, with a laugh; “that is, you
have to run to catch a train, and sometimes you have to
run to catch a ball, so it is much the same thing. But, tell
me, can you go home now, when your house is in plain
sight?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered Mary, and Tommy and Johnny
said the same thing, for there, right down the street, they
could see their house, and they knew they could easily
walk to it.</p>

<p>So they held their toys tightly under their arms, thanked
the kind man, said good-by to him, and walked toward
their house. And just when they were almost there, and
when they could look ahead, and see Suzette, the nursemaid,
waving her hand to them, what should happen but
that along came a wagon, all loaded with Christmas trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115-116]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_115">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_115.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>And Down They Sat Right on the Soft Branches</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You know the kind—nice, tall, green trees, with soft,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>stickery branches; and on Christmas morning presents grow
on the trees, and if the presents are too big they fall down,
and you find them on the floor under the tree. Oh, Christmas
trees are very wonderful, indeed!</p>

<p>“Oh, see the Christmas trees!” cried Mary, as she and
her brothers stopped to look.</p>

<p>“Oh, aren’t they fine!” exclaimed Tommy. And then,
all of a sudden, one of the trees fell off the wagon.</p>

<p>“Quick! We must tell the driver man!” shouted Johnny.
“He doesn’t know he’s lost a tree.”</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe we can pick it up, and take it around to
the front of the wagon to him,” said Mary. So the three
Trippertrot children ran up to the tree. But, as it happened,
the tree was fast to the wagon by a rope, and when the
horses kept on going, of course they pulled the tree along
the street with the wagon, like a boy hitching his sled on
behind the milkman’s sled.</p>

<p>And then, bless your hearts! just as Mary and Tommy
and Johnny ran up to the tree they all stumbled and fell,
and down they sat right on the soft branches, and they
were being dragged along by the wagon.</p>

<p>“Mercy on us!” cried Suzette, the nursemaid, who was
waiting for the children, and who had seen what happened.
“Mercy! There they go off once more!”</p>

<p>Then she was so afraid that the children would be
carried off, and lost again, that she ran after the wagon
and the moving Christmas tree. She grabbed up Mary and
her doll, and set the little girl on her feet. Then she ran
on a little more and grabbed up Johnny and his music-box,
and she set him on his feet, and then she grabbed up
Tommy and his ship, and set him on his feet, and then the
nursemaid ran to the sidewalk with the three children.</p>

<p>“My! That was a narrow escape!” she exclaimed, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
out of breath. “You might all have been lost again. Come
into the house at once. Where have you been? Your
mamma is waiting for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we helped the man get back his hat, that the wind
blew off,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“And just now we were going to tell the man about the
Christmas tree that slipped off his wagon,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Only we didn’t, because we fell down,” spoke Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll tell the man,” said Suzette, the nursemaid. So
she called to the tree man, and he stopped his horses, got
down, and put the Christmas tree back on his wagon, and
he was very thankful that he hadn’t lost it.</p>

<p>Then Suzette took the Trippertrots safely into the house
and they thought they would never run away again. But,
bless you! just wait and see what happens in the next story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER FIFTEEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE TOY SHIP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Up in</span> the nursery of their house the three little Trippertrots
were having a good time. Mary was playing with
her doll that the kind man had bought for her, and Tommy
was playing with his toy ship, and Johnny was playing
with his music-box, making believe he was a hand-organ
man. Only, of course, he didn’t have any monkey, except a
make-believe one.</p>

<p>“Now come on,” said Johnny, as he played a funny
tune called: “If It Should Snow or Hail or Rain, Just Get
Aboard the Choo-Choo Train.” Yes, Johnny played that
tune, and then he called out: “Come on, now, Jacko, climb
up and get the pennies.”</p>

<p>“Why, who in the world are you talking to?” asked his
sister Mary, as she put her doll to bed in her crib.</p>

<p>“Why, I am talking to my monkey,” answered Johnny.
“I am a hand-organ man, and they all have monkeys to
climb up the rainpipes on houses, or else up the front
stoop to get the pennies for the masters. My monkey
doesn’t want to climb, as he is a very little monkey. But I
guess he will soon learn.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any monkey,” spoke Tommy, looking all
around the playroom.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s only a make-believe monkey, just as I am a
make-believe hand-organ man,” explained Johnny. “Only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
my music-box is real, of course, and it plays real tunes.
Listen!”</p>

<p>Then he played another one for his brother and sister,
and they liked it very much.</p>

<p>“I know what I am going to do,” said Johnny, when
the tune was over. “I’m going to put a cushion down on
the floor, and then my little make-believe monkey won’t be
afraid to climb up, for if he falls he won’t get hurt.”</p>

<p>“Why, how funny!” exclaimed Mary. “If he’s a make-believe
monkey he can’t fall, so what good will a cushion
do him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’m only going to put a make-believe, pretend
cushion down for him, so that part is all right,” went on
Johnny, and then Mary and Tommy both laughed, and so
did Johnny.</p>

<p>They went on playing, Mary with her doll, and Tommy
with his toy ship, and Johnny with his music-box and his
make-believe monkey. And he pretended that a chair was a
house, and he had lots of fun making the make-believe
monkey climb up the porch.</p>

<p>After a while Johnny got tired of this game, and Mary
got tired of playing with her doll.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wonder what we can do next?” asked the little
Trippertrot girl.</p>

<p>“I know,” answered Tommy. “We can pretend that my
ship is a real big one, and we can go sailing all over the
world. Where shall we go? Mary can have first choice,
because she is a girl.” And then Tommy put his ship in
the middle of the playroom floor, and the three children
sat around it, and made-believe they were on the deck of
it. “Where shall we go first, Mary?” asked her brother,
politely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Oh, I think I’d like to go to the land where the figs
grow,” said Mary. “I just love figs.”</p>

<p>“So do I!” exclaimed Johnny. “And after that can we
go to the land where the oranges grow?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Tommy. “And, after we come back
from there, with a whole shipload of oranges, we’ll go to
the land of the peanuts, and have a lovely party.”</p>

<p>Well, the Trippertrot children played this game for
some time, and then, all at once, they heard a pitter-patting
out on the porch roof, just as if some one was throwing
beans down from the clouds.</p>

<p>“My! What’s that?” cried Tommy, jumping up and
running to the window.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s raining—and what big drops!” exclaimed
Mary. “It’s a regular summer shower, and here it is pretty
nearly Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s open the window a little way,” suggested
Johnny, “and stick our hands out to get wet. I like to feel
the raindrops on me. It’s like a shower bath, after you’ve
been in bathing in the ocean.”</p>

<p>“But, if it’s cold, we must close the window right off
again,” said Mary, who was a wise little girl. “We mustn’t
get the sniffle-snuffles,” she said.</p>

<p>So the boys agreed to this, and then they opened the
window to let the rain splash on their hands. And it was
a very nice, warm rain, so they thought they wouldn’t get
cold.</p>

<p>My! how those big drops did come down! Faster and
faster they fell, until there was a regular little pond in the
tin gutter of the porch roof.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have an idea!” suddenly cried Tommy. “I’m
going to sail my toy ship here on the roof. There is plenty
of water, and then it can go on a really-truly voyage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“Fine!” exclaimed Johnny.</p>

<p>“But don’t lean too far out,” cautioned Mary. So Tommy
said he wouldn’t, and he got his ship, and put it out on
the porch roof, where there was almost a whole bathtubful
of water.</p>

<p>More rain came down, nice, warm rain, and the wind
blew a little bit and puffed out the sails of the toy ship,
and then, all of a sudden, before any one could stop it, that
ship sailed right over the edge of the porch roof, down and
down in all the raindrops, and then the wind came in a
big, puffing, gusty gust, and lo and behold!</p>

<p>There was Tommy’s nice toy ship blown down to the
street gutter, and as the gutter was filled with water, the
ship was sailing down it as nicely as a little mouse can eat
a bit of cheese. Really, it was, I’m not fooling at all.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh!” cried Mary, as she looked down at the
toy ship sailing away.</p>

<p>“Oh, me! Oh, my!” exclaimed Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” gasped Tommy. “My ship! My
ship! I’ll never see it again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you will!” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“Why, will it sail back to me?” asked his brother.</p>

<p>“No, but we can go after it,” said Johnny. “We can
put on our raincoats, and our rubber boots, and take umbrellas
and run down the street until we find the ship.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but mamma wouldn’t like us to go out,” spoke
Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes, she would,” said Tommy, eagerly. “This is a most
special, extra-extraordinary occasion, and I’ve just got to
get my ship!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123-124]</span></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_123.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>On Ran the Trippertrots, Faster and Faster.</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Besides, it’s a nice, warm rain,” went on Johnny, “and
if we do get a little wet it won’t hurt us. I heard Suzette
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>say she was going to give us our baths to-night, and this
may save her the trouble.”</p>

<p>“All right, if you boys go, I suppose I’ll have to go,
too,” said Mary. So they slipped down to the hall, got on
their rubber boots, and, taking their raincoats and umbrellas,
they let themselves quietly out of the front door
without any one seeing them.</p>

<p>They didn’t mean to do what was naughty, you know,
but they didn’t think, and really Tommy wanted his toy
ship very much. So down the street they ran after it,
through the rain, splashing in and out of puddles, and not
getting very wet at all, and anyhow, it was a very warm
rain, even if it was almost Christmas time.</p>

<p>“I see it! I see it!” suddenly cried Tommy, as they
raced along. “There’s my ship just ahead there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see the white sails,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“And I can see the little flag on it,” added Johnny.
“Come on! Come on!”</p>

<p>On the Trippertrots ran, faster and faster through the
rain, but the toy ship went fast, too, for there was lots of
water in the gutter where it was sailing, and the wind was
blowing quite hard.</p>

<p>On and on the three children raced, but still the toy
ship kept ahead of them. Down one street after another
it sailed, and there was no one on the sidewalks to tell the
Trippertrots that they had better go back home before they
got lost, and they were almost lost now, if they had only
known it.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, as the ship was going along in the
gutter, it happened to strike against a stone, and that made
it stop.</p>

<p>“Come on, we can get it now,” called Tommy, so he
ran a little faster through the rain, and this time he caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
up to his nice little ship and lifted it out of the water. “Ah,
ha! Now I have you back again!” he cried, in delight.</p>

<p>“Oh, but look!” cried Mary, turning slowly around.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“We are lost!” said the little Trippertrot girl. “I don’t
see a single house, or a tree, or a street that I know. We
are certainly lost!”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t worry about it,” spoke Johnny, cheerfully.
“We are always getting lost, but we always get home again
somehow. I think it’s nice to be lost in the rain.”</p>

<p>“And I’m glad I’ve got my ship,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>The children didn’t exactly know what to do, but they
stood there, holding the umbrellas over them, and Tommy
was clasping his ship under his arm, when, all at once, out
from behind a big tree, stepped a jolly sailorman, with a
wooden leg, and as soon as he saw the children he began
to sing this song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Oh, I’m a jolly-jolly sailorman,</div>
<div class="indent">I sail the ocean blue.</div>
<div class="verse">I’ve been in many, many, many lands,</div>
<div class="indent">But I’ve come back to you.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“So now we’ll sail, we’ll sail away again,</div>
<div class="indent">And o’er the seas we’ll roam.</div>
<div class="verse">And when we’ve sailed a million-billion miles</div>
<div class="indent">I’ll bring you all back home.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Ha! ha! How was that for a song, even if I have a
wooden leg?” asked the sailorman. “Wasn’t that pretty
good?”</p>

<p>“It was very nice,” answered Mary, “but, if you please,
sir, we don’t want to sail a million-billion miles.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked the sailor. “I see you have your ship
already with you. Nothing is easier than to sail. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
plenty of water here. Come, we’ll all get aboard,” and he
took Tommy’s ship in his big hands, very carefully.</p>

<p>“No, if you please,” spoke Tommy, “we can’t sail away,
because mamma doesn’t know we ran out.” And he told
the sailorman how the ship had come to be blown off the
porch roof.</p>

<p>“And we got lost chasing after it,” explained Johnny.</p>

<p>“Oh, my! Oh, dear! Oh, me!” laughed the jolly sailorman.
“That is just fine! It’s too jolly for anything!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it is—to be lost,” spoke Mary.</p>

<p>“Why, I’ll take you home,” said the sailorman. “That’s
what I’m for—to take the lost Trippertrots home. Come
with me,” and he stumped off in front of them, banging
his wooden leg down on the sidewalk, and the Trippertrots
laughed because they were happy again.</p>

<p>Now to see what happens next.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER SIXTEEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE MUSIC-BOX</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As he</span> walked along with the Trippertrots the nice
sailorman became more and more jolly every step he took,
with his one wooden leg, and his one regular kind of leg.</p>

<p>“And so you children chased after this toy ship, when it
went floating down the gutter, did you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Mary, and she told how they had been
playing sail Tommy’s little boat on the porch roof in the
rain, when it was blown off, just as I told you in the
adventure before this.</p>

<p>“And so you got lost?” asked the sailorman.</p>

<p>“That’s the way it was,” replied Tommy; “but you will
take us home, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I will,” answered the jolly sailorman, stumping
along on his wooden leg.</p>

<p>“But do you know where we live?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“To be sure I do,” answered the sailorman, with another
jolly laugh. “I can easily find your house. Why, I
have sailed all over the world, and I have found countries
where monkeys live in trees, and throw cocoanuts at you,
and countries where there is gold, and other countries
where there are diamonds, and I have even found countries
where there are little fairies, so it won’t be any trouble for
me to find your house—no trouble at all, I do assure you.
On the contrary, it will be a pleasure for me,” and then he
whistled a jolly tune, and stumped along on his wooden
leg harder than ever.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>And all at once, as the jolly sailorman was whistling a
jolly tune, and singing a jolly song—all at once, I say—out
from behind a big box jumped Jiggily Jig, the funny boy.
He turned a somersault, and he didn’t mind the rain a bit,
and when he was standing right side up again he made a
low bow to the sailorman and said:</p>

<p>“Well, I see you have found the Trippertrot children.
Some one is always finding them, for they are always getting
lost. Don’t you want me to take them home for you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, thank you just the same, Jiggily Jig!” exclaimed
Mary. “Every time you try to take us home we
get lost worse than before. You are very kind, and you
mean all right, but we had rather the jolly sailorman would
take us home. Though you may come along, if you like.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I will,” said Jiggily Jig, as he did a funny
dance in the middle of the sidewalk, then he walked along
with the three Trippertrots and the jolly sailor.</p>

<p>But they didn’t go along so fast now, because Jiggily
Jig had to stop every once in a while to turn a somersault,
or do one of his funny dances. But still they were in no
hurry, and after a while, just as true as I’m telling you,
they came to where Tommy and Johnny and Mary lived.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s our house!” exclaimed Johnny, in surprise.</p>

<p>“The very place!” added Tommy.</p>

<p>“How did you ever find it?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, I told you I had sailed all over the world,” answered
the jolly sailor, “and to find just one house is as
easy for me as eating pie. Why, I once found a whole big
city that was lost.”</p>

<p>“How could a whole city be lost?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“Well, the city wasn’t exactly lost,” explained the jolly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
sailor, “but maybe we were. We were on a ship, just like
Tommy’s, only bigger, away out on the ocean, and we
couldn’t find the city we wanted. It was very foggy, you
know. Then I got up out of bed, and I sniffed and I
smelled, and I says to the captain, says I, ‘I smell apple
pies. They bake apple pies in the city that we can’t find,
and so I know we must be close to it.’ And, sure enough,
we were, for we hadn’t sailed on much farther before we
came to the lost city, and surely enough, everybody in it
was eating apple pies. So that’s how it was, and that’s how
I found your house for you.”</p>

<p>“Why, how funny!” exclaimed Mary. “Mamma was
baking apple pies just before we went out to chase after
Tommy’s ship.”</p>

<p>“I knew it!” cried the jolly sailor. “I can smell apple
pies a good way off. So this is your house, eh? Well, now
I will leave you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you must come in!” said Tommy. “Mamma
will want to thank you for bringing us home. And so will
Suzette, for if you hadn’t brought us home, she would have
had to go after us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, please do come in,” invited Mary. “And you, too,
Jiggily Jig.” So they all went in the Trippertrot house,
and I can’t tell you how glad Mrs. Trippertrot was to see
her children back again, and so was Suzette glad to see
them.</p>

<p>They were also glad to see the jolly sailorman and Jiggily
Jig, and Mrs. Trippertrot at once went out to the
kitchen and got some apple pie, and some glasses of milk,
and gave the children some, and the jolly sailorman some,
and also some to the funny dancing boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I knew I smelled apple pie,” said the sailor, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
rubbed his wooden leg with his napkin. “I can always tell
when I smell apple pie.”</p>

<p>So the jolly sailorman and Jiggily Jig stayed at the
Trippertrot house that night, because it still rained very
hard. And now I am going to tell you what happened the
next day. It was quite an adventure for the Trippertrots.</p>

<p>The children were up in the playroom, showing their
toys to the jolly sailorman, and to Jiggily Jig. Mary
showed her new doll, and Tommy his toy ship, and then
Johnny brought out his music-box, and played some jolly
tunes, and the sailor sang the jolly songs that went with
them.</p>

<p>“We got these for Christmas presents, from the man
whose hat we chased, when the wind had blown it off,”
explained Mary. “Of course it isn’t Christmas yet, but it
will be on Monday, and we children must ask papa for
some money, so we can buy some presents for our friends,”
she said to her two brothers.</p>

<p>“Oh, would you ask your papa for money to buy
presents?” inquired the jolly sailor, while Jiggily Jig was
off in one corner of the room, trying to stand on his head
on a soft cushion.</p>

<p>“Why, how else would we get it, if we didn’t ask
papa?” Tommy wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Why, earn it, of course,” said the jolly sailorman.
“Money that you earn is the best kind of money in the
world, and it buys the nicest kinds of presents, except those
you make for yourself. I would rather have a Christmas
present that some one made for me, than any other kind,
except a kind that some one bought with the money they
had earned.”</p>

<p>“But how can we earn money?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“Oh, there are lots of ways,” answered the jolly sailorman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
just as Jiggily Jig fell down from trying to stand on
his ear. “But, of course, your papa might not like you to
do them, and that wouldn’t be right. But I think I know
of a way that he wouldn’t mind. You can take Johnny’s
music-box, and go out and play jolly tunes, and maybe the
people will give you pennies, and then you can buy some
Christmas presents; that will be better than if you got the
money from your papa.”</p>

<p>“But will the people give money just to hear tunes on
my music-box?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“I think they will, especially if Jiggily Jig and I go
along, to sing and dance,” said the jolly sailorman.</p>

<p>“Oh, will you really do that?” asked Mary, clapping
her hands.</p>

<p>“I will, really,” answered the sailor, as he stumped
about on his wooden leg, and helped Jiggily Jig get up,
for the funny boy was all tangled up in a sofa cushion,
that he had stood on to try and turn a new kind of somersault.</p>

<p>“Oh, then I’ll ask mamma if we can go,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>His mamma said they might, if the sailorman would
take care that the Trippertrot children weren’t lost, and so
it was all arranged that they were to start out the next day.</p>

<p>My, I can’t tell you how excited the three little Trippertrots
were that night! They could hardly sleep, waiting
for next day to come, and Jiggily Jig and the jolly
sailorman stayed at the children’s house, in order to be
there early the next morning.</p>

<p>So they started out, and Mary took her doll along, and
Tommy took his toy ship with him. Of course, Johnny
had his music-box, and oh! he played the nicest tunes!</p>

<p>I wish I could play some of them for you, but I don’t
know much about music, except that I love it, just as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
as you do. They went from house to house, Johnny playing
all the tunes in his music-box, and say, I just wish you
could have seen Jiggily Jig dance! It was as good as going
to the circus. Sometimes he would stand on one leg, and
wave the other in the air, and then, all of a sudden, he
would bounce up, and turn a double somersault, and then
he would stand on his head, and all the while Johnny
would be playing tunes.</p>

<p>And then the jolly sailor! Well, say, he was too nice
for anything! And he sang jolly songs, all about the ocean
blue, and sailing away to distant lands, and about how
storms came up, and made the sky dark, and how the sunshine
came out again. Oh! it was really very fine. And
Mary made-believe her doll danced, and Tommy pretended
that his ship was sailing over the ocean blue, and
then——</p>

<p>Well, the people in the houses, and the children, too,
just loved the funny dances of Jiggily Jig, and the music
that Johnny played, and the songs the sailorman sang, and
they tossed out lots and lots of pennies to the Trippertrots.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you! Thank you!” cried the children, as
they picked them up, and put them in their pockets. “Now
we can buy lots of Christmas presents.”</p>

<p>So they went on from street to street, playing and
dancing and singing, until, at last, along came the man
who had the three trained dancing bears—the big one, the
middle-sized one, and the little one. And when he heard
what the Trippertrots were doing, he said:</p>

<p>“I’ll come with you, and let my bears dance when
Johnny plays his music-box, and perhaps we will get more
pennies.”</p>

<p>So he did that, and, when the people saw the dancing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
bears, they threw out more pennies than ever, until Johnny
and Tommy and Mary had as many as they could carry.</p>

<p>“Now I must take you back home again, so you won’t
get lost,” said the jolly sailorman, and so he did. Then he
was going away again, but Mr. Trippertrot asked him to
stay and have his Christmas dinner with them, and the
sailor said he would.</p>

<p>They wanted Jiggily Jig to stay, too, but he said he
had to eat his Christmas dinner with Simple Simon and
the pieman, and as for the dancing-bear man, he said he
would eat his meal with his pet bears, so the sailorman was
the only one who stayed with the Trippertrots.</p>

<p>And now you may read the story that starts on the next

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER SEVENTEEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS’ CHRISTMAS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Merry Christmas!</span>” cried Mary Trippertrot, as she
jumped out of bed on Christmas morning.</p>

<p>“Merry, merry Christmas!” shouted Tommy.</p>

<p>“Very merry Christmas!” called Johnny.</p>

<p>“And ten thousand of the finest kinds of Christmas joy
to everybody in all the world!” cried the jolly old sailor
with the wooden leg, as he stumped down the stairs after
the Trippertrot children, to see what was on their tree,
and what they had in their stockings. “Ten thousand
million of the merriest Christmas joys!” went on the jolly
sailorman, as he stumped along, for he couldn’t go quite as
fast as could the three children, you know.</p>

<p>But do you suppose that worried him? Not a bit of it!
He was just as jolly and happy and contented with his one
regular leg, and his other wooden leg, as if he had forty-’leven
wooden legs, set with gold and diamonds. So he
stumped along.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, from the parlor where the children had
gone, he heard shouts and laughter, and the singing of
songs, and the blowing on horns and mouth-organs, and
the banging on drums, and the playing of a music-box, and
then the children called again:</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas to everybody, and to papa and
mamma especially, and to Suzette, the nursemaid, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
the jolly sailorman, who brought us home when we were
lost!”</p>

<p>“Bless their hearts!” exclaimed the sailorman with the
wooden leg, as he stumped toward the parlor. “What a
fine thing it is to be a child, and to have Christmas! But
there! I’m happy, too, for I have a wooden leg, and it
isn’t every one who has that.”</p>

<p>Then he went into the room where the Christmas tree
was, all glowing with colored lights, for it was still early
morning, you know, and dark yet. And the stockings were
hung up, too, close by the fireplace, where Santa Claus
didn’t have much trouble to come down and fill them, and
they were filled, too, if you will kindly believe me.</p>

<p>And such a sight as the jolly sailor saw! There were
the children looking at their toys and picture books, and
there stood Suzette, the nursemaid, and Mr. and Mrs.
Trippertrot, looking at the children, and smiling to see
them so happy.</p>

<p>“Well, what did you get, children?” asked the sailorman.</p>

<p>“Oh, what <i>didn’t</i> we get!” gasped Tommy.</p>

<p>“Such a lovely Christmas!” said Mary, with a happy
sigh.</p>

<p>“And such beautiful presents,” murmured Johnny, as he
looked at a little train of cars that ran by electricity, and
the engine had a real electric light in front, to scare pink
or green cows off the track.</p>

<p>And Tommy was beating a drum, and walking around
with a toy gun, making believe he was a soldier.</p>

<p>And what do you think Mary was doing? Why, she
was looking inside and outside of the nicest doll house you
could ever imagine. It had a real chimney on top, and
there was a bathtub, into which you could put real water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
to give a doll a bath, and there was a kitchen with real
dishes in it—only small ones, of course—and there was a
parlor, with a tiny piano in it, and a real rug on the floor.
Oh, but Mary was the happy girl!</p>

<p>And then, of course, there were presents for papa and
mamma, and for Suzette, and—there, if I nearly didn’t
forget the jolly sailorman. But Santa Claus didn’t forget
him. The night before Christmas, Mary had loaned him
one of her stockings, and so had Tommy and Johnny, so
there were three stockings hanging up for the jolly sailorman.
But he said he ought only to hang up one, for his
wooden leg never had a stocking on it. However, they
made him hang up all three, and now every one was filled!</p>

<p>There was a nice knife for him, so he could whittle out
ships for girls and boys, and there was a warm scarf, to
put around his neck, and warm mittens, when he had to
sail the ship in the cold, and a warm coat; not all these in
the stockings, you understand, of course, but on the floor
under them. And then there was some money, so he could
buy a new wooden leg when his old one wore out.</p>

<p>“Oh, but this is a fine Christmas!” cried the jolly sailorman,
and he danced a jig on one leg nearly as well as
Jiggly Jig could on his two legs. And the children
laughed, and were happier than ever.</p>

<p>And, let me see, there’s something else I forgot. There
were candies, and nuts, and oranges, and white grapes, and
figs, and oh! I can’t tell you what else, for there was so
much! And the sailorman was glad he had stayed at the
Trippertrots’ for Christmas.</p>

<p>“Well, now, after you have seen all your toys,” finally
said Mrs. Trippertrot, “you children must get dressed, and
have breakfast. Then you may play some more.”</p>

<p>And after breakfast what fun they had with the jolly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
sailorman! Oh, he was the nicest sailor I have ever known.
I wish you could see him, but it’s not allowed, you know,
and besides, he might knock some splinters off his wooden
leg if he came around to see you all, for there are so many
of you children.</p>

<p>Well, along in the afternoon of Christmas day, when
the Trippertrots had eaten turkey, and cranberry sauce, and
lots of good things, they were looking out of the window of
their nursery-room, for they were a little tired from playing
with all their toys.</p>

<p>“Let’s play our choosing game again,” suggested Mary.
“I choose the first thing that comes along.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Tommy and Johnny, and they stuck
their little stubby noses close against the window glass, as
they could see out better that way.</p>

<p>“And may I play your game, too?” asked the jolly
sailorman.</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Tommy and Johnny, “but we
always let Mary have first choice because she’s a girl, and
that’s polite, you know.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, my hearties!” cried the sailor. And
then Mary, looking from the window, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, see what I got! I was to choose the first thing
that came along, and make-believe it was mine, and look!
It’s a boy and a girl!”</p>

<p>And, as truly as I’m telling you, it was. Along down
the street they were slowly walking; a boy and a girl, holding
hands, and they didn’t look very happy, I’m sorry to
say.</p>

<p>Their clothes were rather ragged, and the three little
Trippertrots could see that the boy’s shoes had big holes in
them, where the snow could come through, for there was
snow on the ground, you know. And the girl’s stockings
had holes in them, where the wind could blow through,
and she had only a thin shawl over her head. And the
boy had no overcoat on, only a thin, little jacket.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Mary. “I—I don’t think I quite
like what I picked out. You—you may have ’em, Tommy.
I’ll take next choice, and maybe I’ll get a red automobile,
and we can go for a make-believe ride.”</p>

<p>Before Tommy could answer, the sailorman said in a
soft sort of voice:</p>

<p>“May I have that little boy and girl?—make-believe,
you know; the same as you play.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” answered Mary. “You may have
them.”</p>

<p>“But what are you going to do with them?” asked
Johnny.</p>

<p>“I—I think I’m going to try to make them happy,”
said the jolly sailor, only his voice wasn’t quite so jolly
now, though it was very kind. “I don’t think they look
very happy, do you? I don’t believe they’ve had any Christmas
at all,” and the sailorman’s voice was low and gentle,
and he blew his nose very hard, almost like a horn.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they’ve had any Christmas, either!”
exclaimed Mary.</p>

<p>“Nor I! Nor I!” added Tommy and Johnny.</p>

<p>“But I know what I’m going to do!” went on the little
Trippertrot girl. “I’m going down and get a whole basketful
of good things to eat, and I’m going to take some of
my toys, and some of the music-box money, and I’m going
to give them to those poor children that I choose. I’m
going to make-believe keep ’em,” she said, to the sailorman,
“and I’m going to try to make ’em happy!”</p>

<p>“So am I!” cried Tommy. “So am I!” cried Johnny.</p>

<p>“I thought you would!” said the sailorman, and now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
his voice was as happy again as heart could wish, and he
was smiling, as he stumped all around the room on his
wooden leg.</p>

<p>And then the Trippertrot children, and the sailorman,
filled a fine big basket of good things to eat, and they put
in some toys for the girl and boy, and some money, and
then they hurried out to give it to them—the sailor stumping
along behind, and blowing his nose like a Christmas
trumpet.</p>

<p>“Here!” cried Mary, as she handed the basket to the
poor boy.</p>

<p>“What—what’s this for?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s for you!” exclaimed Mary. “For your Christmas—to
make you happy!”</p>

<p>“For our Christmas! To make us happy!” repeated the
girl, slowly. “Oh, I—I didn’t think we’d ever have a
Christmas—or be happy again.”</p>

<p>“Nor me,” said her brother. “Oh, how kind you are!”</p>

<p>“It was the jolly sailor who thought of it,” said
Tommy.</p>

<p>“And we’re going home with you, and make you happier
yet,” added Johnny, and then, before the jolly sailorman
could stop them, Mary had seen a big red auto coming
down the street.</p>

<p>“Here,” she cried, “we’ll all get into this. I know the
man will let us.” And, when the auto came rumbling up,
Mary said to the man who was steering it:</p>

<p>“Please take us, and this boy and girl, home to their
house so we can help them have Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly I will,” said the man, kindly. Then
he helped Mary and Tommy and Johnny and the poor boy
and girl into his auto, and he put in the big basket of good
things, and away they all went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“Here! Here! Come back, if you please!” called the
jolly sailor, trying to stump along after them with his
wooden leg. “You Trippertrots will be lost again, sure
pop!”</p>

<p>But Tommy and Mary and Johnny were so interested
in going to make a Christmas for the poor boy and girl,
that they forgot the jolly sailor, and never heard him calling
to them. And they went on and on, farther and farther
away, and what happened when they got to the poor boy’s
and girl’s house I shall have to tell you in the next story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER EIGHTEEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE HUNGRY FAMILY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, well!” exclaimed the sailor, as he stumped on
along behind the automobile, trying to catch it, but he
couldn’t, of course. “Well, well,” he said. “This is certainly
very strange. I never saw such odd children, always
tripping and trotting off some place or other. I wonder
where they’ll land now? I must keep on after them, for
it’s partly my fault that they went to give a Christmas
dinner to the poor boy and girl, so I must bring them
safely back home.”</p>

<p>Well, the automobile kept going faster and faster, for
the kind man in it had promised to take the children to
where the poor boy and girl lived, and he was doing it.
And now I will start and tell you what happened to the
children, and then, later, I will tell you what happened to
the jolly old sailor.</p>

<p>“Do you live very far from here?” asked Tommy Trippertrot,
of the poor boy, as he helped him hold the big
basket of turkey, and other good things to eat.</p>

<p>“Oh, not very far,” replied the poor boy. “And we will
soon be there, if this auto keeps on going as fast as this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will surely do that,” said the man who owned it.</p>

<p>“And didn’t you really have any Christmas dinner?”
asked Mary, of the poor girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, my, no!” exclaimed the poor girl. “We haven’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
had a Christmas dinner in so long that I’ve forgotten how
one tastes. Papa hasn’t any work, you know, and mamma
isn’t very well, and—and——”</p>

<p>“And we don’t have even ordinary every-day dinners
very often!” exclaimed the poor boy.</p>

<p>“Hush!” said his sister, softly; “you mustn’t tell all your
troubles.”</p>

<p>“Well, aren’t we often hungry?” he asked. “You know
we are!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied his sister, “but we’re going to have something
to eat <i>now</i>,” and she looked at the basket of good
things that Mary and her brothers had packed for them.</p>

<p>“Where do you want me to take you?” asked the auto
man. “Do you know where your house is?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean us, or them?” asked Tommy, as he looked
at the poor boy and girl.</p>

<p>“Because, if you mean us,” went on Johnny, “we don’t
know where our house is. We’re lost again, I can easily
tell that.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“Because we are always getting lost,” spoke Mary.
“And, besides, we’ve never been on this street before, or
in this part of the city. Oh, there’s no doubt of it—we’re
lost, but we don’t care. It happens so often that we’re used
to it by this time.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” said Johnny, “some one is sure to come for
us. Either the old fisherman, or the pink-cow man, or Jiggily
Jig, the funny boy, or Simple Simon, or the pieman.
Oh! some one will find us and take us home.”</p>

<p>“Besides, there’s the jolly sailor,” remarked Mary.</p>

<p>“That’s so!” cried Johnny. “We forgot him. I wonder
where he is?”</p>

<p>“You left him behind,” replied the poor boy. “I heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
him calling after us, but I thought he wanted to stop us
from having a Christmas dinner, or for going too fast, so I
didn’t say anything.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the poor, jolly sailorman!” cried Mary. “I hope
he is all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he can take care of himself,” said the auto
man, with a smile. “But now can you tell me where you
live?” he asked of the poor boy and girl. “I do hope
you aren’t lost.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” answered the poor girl. “We live away
at the other end of the city, and it’s not in a very nice
place. If you don’t want to take your auto there, you can
stop at the corner, and we can walk the rest of the way.”</p>

<p>“I guess my auto isn’t afraid of poor streets, as long
as there aren’t any tacks in them, to make holes in the
tires,” spoke the man, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Then they went on for quite some distance farther, and,
all of a sudden, the man cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, look! What is that funny thing? It keeps jumping
up and down, and then turning over. What can it be?”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked all the children, as they looked around,
and the man pointed right ahead of his auto.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Jiggily Jig!” exclaimed Mary, in surprise, as
she saw the funny boy doing his funny dance in the street
and turning his funny somersaults. “How in the world did
he ever get here?”</p>

<p>“I danced all the way,” answered Jiggily Jig, as he
heard Mary speak. “I was paying a visit to Simple Simon,
and the pieman, but they had to go to the fair, to sell the
pieman’s pieware, and so I went off dancing by myself.
But I’m very glad to meet you all again,” and he made
such funny little bows, and sang such a queer little song,
and was altogether so happy and jolly, that he was almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
as good as the sailor with the wooden leg, and the poor
boy cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish we had some one jolly like that at our
house.”</p>

<p>“Why, Jiggily will come; won’t you?” asked Mary.
“Won’t you come and help us make a jolly Christmas for
these new friends of ours?” and she pointed to the poor
boy and girl.</p>

<p>“Of course I will!” answered Jiggily, quickly. “I’ll
sing and dance and turn somersaults. I can somersault all
the way there, if you want me to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, get into the auto,” invited the man, and soon
Jiggily was riding along with the others. And in a little
while they came to the place where the poor family lived.
And it was also a very hungry family, as well as very
poor, for none of them had had anything to eat that day,
and the papa had no work to earn money, and the mamma
was sick, and there were some other children besides the
poor boy and girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma!” cried the poor girl, as she rushed into
the house with the big basket of good things to eat, which
her brother helped carry, “we have a Christmas dinner at
last!”</p>

<p>“And real turkey,” said the boy, his eyes opening very
big, as he thought of the good things in the basket.</p>

<p>Well, I can’t tell you how pleased the poor, hungry
family was at what the Trippertrots had brought. They
almost cried, they were so happy, and then they began to
eat, and Jiggily Jig did some of his funny dances, and
made them all laugh. Of course, he and Tommy, Mary
and Johnny, didn’t eat, because they had had their Christmas
dinners that day, and so weren’t hungry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>Then, all of a sudden, there was a noise outside, and the
auto man called:</p>

<p>“Well, good-by, I’m going!”</p>

<p>“Wait! You must take the Trippertrots home!” called
the poor girl after him.</p>

<p>“Oh, that would be of no use,” spoke Mary, quickly.
“We don’t know where we live, and it would take too
much time riding around trying to find our house.”</p>

<p>“But what will you do?” asked the poor man, who was
the head of the hungry family, as the auto puffed off.</p>

<p>“Oh, some one will be sure to come for us,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Tommy and Johnny, and they
looked around the room, where the hungry family lived. It
wasn’t a very nice room, but it was clean. And as for the
hungry family, they weren’t hungry any more, because they
had eaten nearly all the things in the basket. It was like
when the Trippertrots took the Thanksgiving dinner to the
poor family, you know.</p>

<p>And, all of a sudden, ten cute, little, tiny mice peeked
out from a hole in the floor, and they made their whiskers
go backward and forward, and they sniffed with their
sharp little noses, and their bright eyes looked all around.</p>

<p>“Oh, aren’t they too dear for anything!” exclaimed
Mary. “I wonder what they want?”</p>

<p>“I guess they want to be fed, too,” spoke the poor boy.
“They live in this house, and they’re hungry, too. Nearly
everybody around here is hungry, I guess, the same as we
were.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll give them some crumbs,” suggested Johnny,
and the children did this, and I just wish you could have
seen the mice eat them up. It was Christmas for them,
too.</p>

<p>So Mary and Tommy and Johnny Trippertrot stayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
all that afternoon at the house of the hungry family, and
they played games, and had a good time. But still no one
came for the runaways.</p>

<p>“I wonder if no one is ever coming?” said Mary. “We
can’t stay here forever.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’re welcome, as long as you like to stay,”
said the poor lady, kindly.</p>

<p>“But what has become of Jiggily Jig?” asked Johnny.
“He might know his way to our house by this time.”</p>

<p>“Jiggily Jig went dancing off after the auto,” said the
poor man of the hungry family.</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see what has happened to the jolly
sailorman,” spoke Mary. “He ought to be along soon.”</p>

<p>And now I am going to tell you what happened to him.
As he was stumping along on his wooden leg trying to
catch up to the auto with the Trippertrots in it, all of a
sudden, he stepped into a mud-hole under some snow, and
his wooden leg went away down in, and he couldn’t get it
out again.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I’m stuck here, and I can’t keep on after
Mary and Tommy and Johnny,” he cried. “Oh, what bad
luck!”</p>

<p>Then he tried harder and harder to get his wooden leg
out of the hole, but he couldn’t. He was stuck fast. So
that’s the reason he couldn’t go get the Trippertrots, for,
you see, he knew he could find the place where they were,
as he was a sailor, and had sailed all over the world, and
could find any place. But the Trippertrots didn’t know
why the jolly sailor didn’t come.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER NINETEEN<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE ELEPHANT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh, dear!</span> Oh, dear! Oh, me! Oh, my!” cried the jolly
sailorman, as he pulled and struggled and twisted this way
and that, trying to get his wooden leg loose. “Whatever
shall I do?”</p>

<p>He looked all around to see if any one was coming to
help him, but he could see no one, for it was still Christmas
day, you remember, and I suppose most of the people
were in their houses, sleeping after dinner, and the children
were playing with their toys, and even the policemen
must have had some presents to look at, for none of the
officers were around to help the jolly sailorman.</p>

<p>I suppose you wonder how he could be jolly when he
was in such trouble—his wooden leg stuck in the mud, and
night coming on, when it would soon be cold and dark.
And then, too, he was worried about what might happen to
the Trippertrots, for he was sort of responsible for their
having run away this time.</p>

<p>But, in spite of all that, the sailorman was real jolly,
even as he pulled and tugged to get his wooden leg loose
from the mud-hole. He laughed and he joked, even though
there was no one there to hear him, and he even sang a
little song that went something like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Here I am, stuck hard and fast.</div>
<div class="verse">But surely I’ll get out at last.</div>
<div class="verse">And when I do I think I’ll take</div>
<div class="verse">And boil myself a chocolate cake!”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>Then he whistled and sung the second verse, which tells
about roasting a lemon pie, and once more he cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, will I ever get out of here?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I think so,” said a pleasant voice behind
him, and there stood a great, big, kind elephant, with his
trunk all packed ready to take a journey, and there was no
man with him, only just the big elephant, all alone by
himself.</p>

<p>“Did—did you speak?” asked the sailorman of the elephant,
wondering whether he was dreaming or not.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I did,” answered the big animal. “Have
you any objections? For if you have——”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not any, I do assure you,” spoke the sailor,
quickly. “Only I didn’t know that elephants could speak.”</p>

<p>“Neither did I until I tried,” said the elephant. “One
seldom does know what one can do until one tries. However,
I’m glad I can speak, because I want to help you,
but there are two things I’d like to mention before I do.”</p>

<p>“What are they?” asked the sailor. “Please ask them
as quickly as you can, for my wooden leg is freezing fast
in the mud, and I fear I shall never get loose in time to go
get the Trippertrot children.”</p>

<p>“Well, my first question,” said the elephant, “is why
did you sing about boiling a chocolate cake? A cake is
baked, never boiled, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the sailor, “that just shows how little I
<i>do</i> know. I never made a chocolate cake, though I am
very fond of them, and I supposed boiling them was as good
as baking.”</p>

<p>“Never,” spoke the elephant through his long nose.
“Never!”</p>

<p>“Well, what is your second question?” asked the jolly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
sailor, thinking how strange it was for the big animal to
talk.</p>

<p>“For my second question,” spoke the elephant, “I should
like to know how you could roast a lemon pie?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I was wrong about that, too, just as I
was about the cake,” admitted the sailor.</p>

<p>“You were,” said the elephant, flagging his big ears,
“but no matter. You will know better next time you sing.
Now I am going to help you out of the mud.”</p>

<p>And with that, the big, kind elephant put his trunk
around the sailor’s wooden leg, close to where it was stuck
in the mud, and he gave a long, strong pull, that brave
elephant did, and up came the wooden leg, not a bit the
worse from having been stuck in the mud, and the sailor
was able to stump around on it once more as well as ever.</p>

<p>“Ah, thank you very much,” the sailorman said to the
elephant. “Now I can go get the Trippertrot children.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll go with you!” exclaimed the elephant. “I
will let you ride on my back, and the children can ride
there, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be fine,” cried the jolly sailor. “But how
does it happen that you are going about by yourself, and
are not in the circus? Especially on Christmas day.”</p>

<p>“That is easily explained,” said the elephant. “You see,
I am so well trained that the circus men trust me to go
about all alone by myself. I am a trick elephant, you
know, and I go to houses and do tricks for the people, and
for the children. Shall I do some tricks for you?”</p>

<p>“One or two, if you please,” answered the sailor, “and
then we must start after those children, for it is growing
late.”</p>

<p>So the elephant did the funny trick of standing on one
leg, and waving his trunk in the air, and then he stood up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
on the end of his trunk and waved his four feet in the air,
and that was really very good. Indeed it was!</p>

<p>“Now get up on my back,” the elephant said to the
sailor, “and away we’ll go after those children, for I just
love children.”</p>

<p>And then, as easily as the baby can cry when it’s
hungry, or when a pin sticks in it, which I hope never
happens—as easily as that, I say—the elephant lifted the
sailor in his trunk, and set him upon his back.</p>

<p>Away they started, and that sailor knew just where to
look for the Trippertrot children, for he remembered which
way the auto had gone with the poor boy and girl, and, in
a little while, there they were—the sailor and the jolly elephant—oh,
I mean the jolly sailor and the elephant were
at the house of the poor family.</p>

<p>They could hear laughter and shouting inside, and they
knew the poor people had been made happy by the Trippertrots.
So the elephant tapped on the door with his trunk,
and my goodness sakes alive! How surprised Tommy and
Johnny and Mary were to see the big animal standing
there, with the jolly sailor on his back.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wonder if it’s a real elephant?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>“We must be dreaming!” exclaimed Tommy. “Here,
Johnny, you pinch me, and that will tell if I’m awake or
not.”</p>

<p>So Johnny pinched Tommy and he pinched his brother’s
leg harder than he meant to, for Tommy cried “Ouch!”
Then he knew he was awake, for he could feel the pinch
as quickly as anything.</p>

<p>“I guess it must be a real elephant,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Well, if you have some real peanuts here I can eat
them,” said the elephant, speaking through his long nose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
“And then you can be sure about it.” And, as it happened,
Johnny did have some peanuts in his pocket, and he gave
them to the elephant, who ate them, and that proved that
he was real, and not a dream.</p>

<p>“Come!” cried the jolly sailor, “I have come to take
you home, children. It is getting late, and your papa and
mamma will be worried about you, and so will Suzette,
the nursemaid.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but can’t we look at the elephant a little while,
before you take him away?” asked the poor children.</p>

<p>“Yes,” kindly said the elephant, “I’ll stay a little while,
and do some of my tricks for you.” Then he explained
how he suddenly found that he could talk, and he liked it
very much, and so he kept on doing it. I, myself, don’t
know how an elephant can talk, so, if you please, don’t ask
me why. But I know this one did it, just the same.</p>

<p>Then he did a lot of tricks, such as sitting down on the
wash-bench, and sucking a whole lot of water up his nose,
and then squirting it out again, like a fire engine. And he
lifted all the children up together, as they stood on a table,
and he sat down on a very strong chair, and rang the
dinner bell, only, of course, everybody had had dinner,
and so they didn’t eat again. And then the elephant played
a mouth-organ that Tommy had given the poor boy—what
do you think of that?—the elephant played it by blowing
on it through his trunk.</p>

<p>“Well, now it’s time to go home,” said the jolly sailor
at last. So they said good-by to the poor family, and Mary
and Tommy and Johnny promised to send them something
more to eat, and some warm clothes to wear, and the sailor
said he would ask Mr. Trippertrot to get the poor man
some work—and he did, I’m glad to say.</p>

<p>“Up on my back!” cried the elephant, as he walked out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
of the poor family’s house, for it was a very large house,
you know, and had once belonged to a rich family, so an
elephant could easily get in it through the wide doors.
Then the elephant lifted Mary and Tommy and Johnny
up on his back, and then the sailor—the jolly sailor, you
know—and away they started through the night (for it was
now dark) to the Trippertrot home. The jolly sailor knew
the way very well, and so the children could enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, a man came running along.
“Hold on there, Mr. Elephant!” he called.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked the elephant.</p>

<p>“Why, I guess you have forgotten that you are to do
your tricks in my theatre to-night,” said the man. “You
must come with me, if you please.”</p>

<p>“So I must,” spoke the elephant. “I did forget. I
can’t go along any farther with you children just now.”</p>

<p>“But how are we ever to get home?” asked Mary,
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry about that,” said the elephant, kindly.
“I will send my friend, the two-humped camel, along, and
you can ride home on his back—you and the sailor.”</p>

<p>So the elephant lifted them all down off his back with
his trunk, and when he had told them good-by, and
promised to see them again, he went off with the man to
do his tricks in the theater, and the Trippertrots and the
jolly sailor were left standing in the street. And it got
darker and darker.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ADVENTURE NUMBER TWENTY<br>

<small>THE TRIPPERTROTS AND THE TWO-HUMPED CAMEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">How</span> long do you suppose it will be before the two-humped
camel gets here?” asked Mary, as she and her
brothers waited in the street with the jolly sailor.</p>

<p>“I hope the elephant sends him along pretty soon,” said
Johnny.</p>

<p>“I think I see something coming,” answered Tommy,
slowly, and then, all of a sudden, they all heard a queer
voice singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“I’m a great big two-humped camel,</div>
<div class="indent">From a sandy desert waste,</div>
<div class="verse">And I’m coming now to get you, dears,</div>
<div class="indent">With most particular haste.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“I’ll ride you far upon my back,</div>
<div class="indent">Between my fuzzy humps,</div>
<div class="verse">And try to step most softly o’er</div>
<div class="indent">The lumpy, bumpy-bumps.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Oh, I do believe that’s our camel!” cried Mary, in
delight.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it is,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“And I’m glad it is,” added Johnny, for now he was as
hungry as his brother, and wanted to get home to supper.</p>

<p>“Avast and belay there!” called the sailor, in his jolly
voice. “Are you the camel which the kind elephant was
to send to take the Trippertrots and me back home?”</p>

<p>“I am that very self-same individual and particular
camel,” was the answer, for, you see, the camel could talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
just like the elephant, only not so much through his nose.
And then he came closer, and my! how big and tall he
was! and what a long, funny curve there was to his neck.
But what the children liked best of all was to see on his
back, between his humps, a little house, with long, soft,
warm red curtains all around it, and inside a red lamp
was burning, and it looked just as nice and warm and cosy
as it could be.</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t we have fun going home in that!” cried
Tommy.</p>

<p>“Won’t we just, though!” said Johnny, jumping up and
down.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s just like a cabin in a ship,” the sailor declared.
“This is just fine!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but look how high up it is!” cried Mary. “I
never can climb up there—never—never! And there is no
ladder!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry,” said the two-humped camel, kindly.
“I will show you how you can get in the little house on
my back with no more trouble than it is to wash your
face. Are you all ready to start for home?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” said all the Trippertrot children at once.</p>

<p>And then the camel gave a grunt, and he knelt down in
the street, and that made his back come quite low, and the
little house with the red lamp and the red curtains was near
enough so that the jolly sailor could lift up Mary and
Tommy and Johnny into it.</p>

<p>“Now, hold fast!” cried the camel, “for it sort of jiggles
one about, when I get up off my knees. Hold fast.”</p>

<p>Inside the house were some benches, and a little table,
and the children and the sailor held fast to the benches.
And it is a good thing they did, or they might have fallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
out, for the camel nearly stood on his head when he got up
off his knees.</p>

<p>“Now, here we go,” called the camel, and off he started
for the Trippertrot home, swinging along with big strides.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, the children, who had drawn
the curtains of the little red house close together, so they
couldn’t see outside—all at once, I say, they heard some one
shout:</p>

<p>“Hold on, stop, if you please! I’d like to come up
there!”</p>

<p>“Shall I stop?” asked the camel, of the jolly sailorman,
turning his long neck around so he could look into the
little house on his back.</p>

<p>“Well, who wants to come up here?” inquired Mary.</p>

<p>“If it’s Jiggily Jig, or the pieman, or Simple Simon, let
them come,” added Johnny.</p>

<p>“Especially if it’s the pieman,” spoke Tommy, “for I
would love a pie now.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t any of them,” said the camel, as he stopped
and looked at the person who had called to him. “It’s the
old fisherman. Do you want him to come up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” cried all the children at once, “and perhaps
he can fish up something for us to eat,” added Tommy,
who was getting hungrier and hungrier.</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the camel, “come on up, Mr.
Fisherman.”</p>

<p>“My! how nice and cosy it is here!” cried the old
fisherman. “And how glad I am to see you all! Isn’t it
fine to ride on a camel?”</p>

<p>“It is,” agreed Johnny.</p>

<p>“And it would be nicer if we had something to eat,”
put in Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“Well, we will soon be at your house,” spoke the camel,
“but if you can’t wait, why, perhaps the old fisherman can
catch something for you. He catches such odd things when
he fishes.”</p>

<p>“Will you please try?” asked Mary, of the old fisherman.</p>

<p>“To be sure I will,” he said, kindly. So he took a piece
of clothes-line, and his hammock-hook, which wasn’t sharp
enough to hurt any one, and he dangled it out of the little
house, over the side of the camel. And then, all of a
sudden, he pulled it up, and there, fast to the hook, were a
lot of nice pies.</p>

<p>“Here you are!” cried the old fisherman, as he passed
the pies around.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Who took my pies? Who took my pies?”
suddenly cried a voice down on the ground.</p>

<p>“It’s the pieman, and Simple Simon is with him,” spoke
the camel. “Your hook went right into his basket of pies,
old fisherman, and you hooked up some.”</p>

<p>“Who took my pies? Who took my pies?” cried the
pieman, once more.</p>

<p>“I did, for the Trippertrot children,” answered the old
fisherman, sticking his head out between the curtains of the
little house. “Is that all right?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, surely,” answered the pieman. “The Trippertrots
can have all my pies they want for nothing. Good-by,
I have to go home to bake some more. Good-by.”</p>

<p>So he and Simple Simon hurried away, and the Trippertrots
and the jolly sailor and the old fisherman in the
little house on the camel’s back ate the pies, and the camel
ate some, too, and then he ran as fast as anything, and in a
little while he was at the Trippertrot house, and the runaway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
children were safely home at last. And, oh! how
glad their papa and mamma and Suzette were to see them.
And they thanked the old fisherman, and the jolly sailor,
and the camel, for taking such good care of the little ones.</p>

<p>Then the two-humped camel went back to see the elephant
do tricks in the theatre.</p>

<p>And now I think I have told you enough stories of the
three little Trippertrots for this book, but if you should
happen to want any more I believe I can write them for
you. Mind, I’m not saying for sure, but I might, and if I
do, they will be in the third book, which will be called
“Three Little Trippertrots and Their Winter Fun.” And
I will tell how they built a snow fort, how they went sliding
down hill, how they chased after an airship, and did
many other queer things.</p>

<p>But, for a while, we will bid them good-by, for they
are very tired from their many Christmas adventures and
must go to bed.</p>
